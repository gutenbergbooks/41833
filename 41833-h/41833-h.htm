<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, April 17th, 1780.</p>
<p class="open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>Late letters from Dantzic imply, that commerce was
become very languishing there for some time, excepting for
ship timber, which bore a very good price there, on account
of the English, and which they carried away, as well
in their own vessels as those of Dantzic.</p>

<p>The new face, which the affairs of Europe are about to
take from the alliance formed between the powers of the
North for the maintenance of an exact neutrality, and to
which people here are fully persuaded that the Republic
of the United Provinces will agree, gives occasion to conjectures,
either, that the war will be pushed this year with
more vivacity than ever, both by land and sea, or that
peace may be made without delay. They say, even that
there may have been already negotiations commenced on
this subject; that it is by the intervention of the King of
Sardinia, who would manage the accommodation between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the belligerent powers, and that his present Ambassador in
France is so much the better able to labor usefully
towards this great work, that having resided in England in
the same quality he has the advantage to know perfectly
the Ministers and their system. However this may be, if
there are sometimes occasions in which one may judge
of future events by an examination of the present, and reflection
upon the past, might one be taxed with partiality
or temerity, if one ventured to lay it down as a fact, that,
from the beginning of the contest in which Great Britain is
at present engaged, her situation has never appeared so
critical and so dangerous? In fact, as if it was not enough,
that she had quarrelled with her Colonies, as if it was not
enough, that she is at war with two powers so formidable
as France and Spain in consequence of the quarrel with
the Colonies, as if her intestine troubles were not enough,
which, by dividing the nation, contribute not a little to
weaken it; and at the end of the perspective, to see Ireland,
at the first moment, make as much of it as the Americans,
in declaring herself also independent. In spite of so
many alarming considerations, England still seems to seek
new enemies, by attacking without distinction the vessels of
all the neutral nations, and even of her allies. Thus she
has forced them by this proceeding, not less arbitrary than
inconceivable, especially in her present circumstances, to
make a league with each other for the maintenance of the
safety of the navigation of their respective subjects, as
well as of the honor of their flags, for which they plainly
acknowledge at this day, that they never could have
hoped for any safety, if the English, who, embarrassed as
they are, treat them nevertheless with so little ceremony,
could ever recover that superiority, whereof we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
deny that they found means to put themselves in possession
at the end of the last war.</p>

<p>But such is the fate of all human things; to have a
commencement, to acquire successively an augmentation,
which ought to be expected up to certain bounds, and beyond
which they must necessarily begin to decrease, until
they descend again to the same point from whence they
began; and no human efforts can disturb this constant and
immutable order. After this declaration let us judge
whether in fact, this is not the case of England, and we
may after this predict very nearly the issue of the present
events, or of those which may take place in the course of
the year.</p>

<p>By the English papers, Congress will see the state of
parties in England, where the stubble is so dry, that the
smallest spark thrown into it may set the whole field in
a blaze. Opposition have carried triumphantly in the
fullest House of Commons ever known, by a majority of
eighteen votes against the utmost efforts of the Ministry,
the resolution, that it is necessary to declare, that the
influence of the Crown has increased, increases, and ought
to be diminished; that it is in the power of the House
to take cognizance of, and to reform the abuses, which
may exist in the employment of the civil list revenues,
as well as all other revenues; and that it is the duty of
the House to grant effectual redress to the grievances,
exposed in the petitions presented to the House by the
different cities, counties, and towns of the kingdom. By
the speech of Mr Fox, it will be seen to what soaring
heights this young statesman aspires.</p>

<p>Since my arrival the last time in Europe, I have had,
six and forty times, I think, the honor of writing to Congress;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but it seems impossible to get a letter across the
Atlantic. Many of my letters have been waiting long at
the seaports for a passage, but when they will obtain it, I
know not; if they all arrive, and Congress should be able
to see at one view the vast chain that is binding almost all
mankind every day closer and faster together, in opposition
to the dangerous power, and the intolerable possessions
of the English, they will see how many of the wisest
hands in the world are at work for their safety and glory,
and have the utmost cause of gratitude to Heaven for
ordering events in the course of his Providence so decidedly
in their favor.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, April 18th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It is my duty to transmit to Congress, as soon as prudence
will admit, everything which deserves consideration,
as having either a direct, or an indirect tendency to peace,
or even to negotiations for that important object. The enclosed
letter has been transmitted to Paris through such a
channel, that I have reason to believe, that it was particularly
intended for my inspection. It is from a gentleman,
who, to do him justice, has long expressed an earnest desire
for peace, but who, nevertheless, has never yet reflected
maturely enough upon the state of America, of Great Britain,
and of all Europe, to get into a right way of thinking,
concerning the proper means to his end. Congress will perceive
this from the letter itself, in which it is obvious enough.</p>

<p>The first remarkable sentiment is, "We must at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
events support our national honor, by the most vigorous
exertions, without shrinking; but surely, in such a complicated
war as this is, if we can make any equitable offers of
a treaty to any of the parties, common prudence calls upon
us to use our endeavors to unravel by negotiation, the combination
of powers now acting against us." In this paragraph,
I see the manifest marks of a mind that has not yet
mastered its subject. True policy would have omitted
everything in this letter, which should call up to the minds
of the people the ideas of national honor. Every man in
the world, who is thoroughly acquainted with the subject,
knows that Great Britain never can obtain a peace without
a diminution of her honor and dignity. It is impossible
without miracles, and therefore the Englishman, who undertakes
to plan for peace, must be convinced of this and
take it into his plan, and consequently should avoid with
the utmost caution every word, which should excite these
ideas in the minds of the people. They stir passions
which make them mad.</p>

<p>He should have avoided with equal solicitude every insinuation
of a design to unravel, by negotiation, the combination
of powers now acting against Great Britain. This
combination is in fact much more extensive, much more
universal and formidable, than the letter writer had any
idea or suspicion of. But if it had been no more extensive
than France, Spain, and America, the impracticability
of unravelling it ought to have thrown out this sentiment.
By it he proposes by negotiation to bring those to dishonor
themselves, who have certainly no occasion for it; at the
same time that he stimulates others to cherish and preserve
their honor, who have already lost it, and under an absolute
necessity, sooner or later, of sacrificing it. By this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
means he only puts the confederates more upon their
guard, and renders the attainment of his professed object,
peace, impossible.</p>

<p>The next solecism in politics, which he commits, is undertaking
to vindicate America from the charge of having
sought and formed this confederacy. America wanted no
such vindication; it is folly to suppose it a fault, for all
mankind will agree, even his correspondents themselves,
that it was wisdom and virtue. Surely another term must
be given to popular ideas, before they will be brought to
petition for peace.</p>

<p>Nor do I think it was prudent in him to hold up the idea,
that America had proceeded with reluctance and regret to
the Treaty. That this is true, I know and feel to this very
moment; for although I had no such reluctance myself,
those gentlemen with whom I had the honor to sit in Congress
at the time will remember, that I had very good reasons
to be sensible that others had. But how well soever
he might be informed of the fact, and from what source soever
he might draw his information, it was bad policy in
him to hold it up, because he ought to have been equally
sure, that America has now no reluctance to the treaty, nor
any inclination to violate it. He ought not, therefore, to
have held up a hope of this to the people.</p>

<p>Neither ought he to have flattered the people with hopes,
that America would not form any perpetual alliance with
France, nor that their limited alliance might be satisfied
and discharged. The alliance already made is limited, it
is true, to a certain number of articles, but not limited in
its duration. It is perpetual, and he had no grounds to
sooth the people with hopes, either that France would
give up any of the articles of the treaty, or that America
would violate them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>He ought also to have avoided his insinuations, that America
has been so much harassed by the war. This is an
idea so refreshing to the present passions of the people of
England, that, instead of tending to dispose them to peace,
it only revives their hopes of success, and inflames their
ardor for war. That America has been harassed by the war
is true, and when was any nation at war without being so?
Especially, when did any nation undergo a revolution in
government, and sustain a war at the same time without it?
Yet, after all, America has not been so much harassed, or
disastered, or terrified, or panic-struck from the beginning,
as Great Britain has been several times in the course of it.</p>

<p>But the most exceptionable passage of all, is this. "It
is apparent to all the world, that <em>France might long ago
have put an end to that part of the war, which has been
most distressing to America</em>, if she had chosen so to do.
Let the whole system of France be considered, from the
very beginning, down to the last retreat from Savannah,
and I think it is impossible to put any other construction
upon it, but this, viz. that it has always been the deliberate
intention and object of France, for purposes of her own,
to encourage the continuation of the war in America, <em>in
hopes of exhausting the strength and resources of this
country, and of depressing the rising power of America</em>."</p>

<p>Upon this paragraph I scarcely know what remarks to
make. But after deliberating upon it, as patiently and
maturely as I can, I will clearly write my opinion of it;
for my obligations to truth and to my country are antecedent
to all other ties.</p>

<p>I am clearly and fully of the opinion, then, that the
fact is true, that France might put an end to that part of
the war, which has been most distressing to Americans;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and I certainly know the means were extremely simple and
obvious, and that they were repeatedly proposed, and explained,
and urged to the Ministry; and I should have had
a terrible load of the guilt of negligence of my duty upon
my conscience, if it had not been done while I had the
honor of a commission to this Court. But, when the letter
writer proceeds so far as to say, that it was to <em>encourage</em>
the continuance of the war, in order to exhaust the
strength and resources of Great Britain, I cannot accompany
him, much less can I join with him in the opinion,
that it was to depress the rising power in America. I believe,
on the contrary, that France has not wished the continuance
of the war, but that she has wished for peace.
The war has been attended with too much loss and danger
to France, to suppose, that she wished its continuance, and
if she did not wish its continuance at all, she could not
wish it to depress the power of America.</p>

<p>She could not wish it, in my opinion, for this reason,
because it is not the means to this end. It has a contrary
tendency. The longer this war is continued in America,
the more will America become habituated to the characters
of the soldier and the marine. Military virtues and
talents and passions will gain strength, and additional activity,
every year while the war lasts; and the more these
virtues, talents, and passions are multiplied, the deeper will
the foundations of American power be laid, and the more
dangerous will it become to some or other of the powers
of Europe; to France, as likely as to any other power,
because it will be more likely to be ambitious and enterprising,
and to aspire at conquests by sea and land.</p>

<p>This idea, however, deserves to be considered with all
the attention that Americans can give to it; although I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
convinced by everything I see and read and hear, that all
the powers of Europe, except, perhaps, the House of Austria,
and I am not very clear in that exception, rejoice in
the American revolution, and consider the independence of
America as for their interest and happiness, in many points
of view, both respecting commerce and the balance of
Europe; yet I have many reasons to think, that not one
of them, not even Spain, nor France, wishes to see America
rise very fast to power. We ought, therefore, to be
cautious how we magnify our ideas, and exaggerate our
expressions of the generosity and magnanimity of any of
these powers. Let us treat them with gratitude, but with
dignity. Let us remember what is due to ourselves and
to our posterity, as well as to them. Let us, above all
things, avoid, as much as possible, entangling ourselves
with their wars or politics. Our business with them, and
theirs with us, is commerce, not politics, much less war.
America has been the sport of European wars and politics
long enough.</p>

<p>I think, however, that this letter writer was very much
mistaken in his judgment, when he threw out this language.
It could be meant only to excite a jealousy and a
quarrel between France and America, or rather feed the
Yorkshire people, and the people of England with a hope
of exciting such a quarrel. This is not the way to come
at a peace. They will never succeed in such a plan, and
every attempt towards it is a false policy.</p>

<p>The next mistake is, the idea of a reconciliation and
federal union with America. This must be intended to
separate us from our allies, which this gentleman ought,
before now, to have known is totally impracticable.</p>

<p>I have very little more relish for the notion of a truce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
We are in a safer way at war. We cannot make a truce
without France. She will never consent, that we should
make a truce, unless she makes a peace; and such alterations
may be made in the constitutions of the Courts of
France and Spain, and in the other Courts and political
connexions in Europe, before the expiration of the term of
a truce, that it would be attended with too much hazard to
us. Neither France, nor Spain, nor the other powers of
Europe, might, after a truce, be ready to go to war again;
and unforeseen divisions may be excited among ourselves
by artful emissaries from England. We are going on now
in a sure and certain road. If we go out of it, we may be
lost.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I think, that this letter writer should
have stated the true situation of Europe, of Great Britain,
Ireland, and America.</p>

<p>From this statement, his immediate conclusion should
have been open conferences for peace; make peace with
all the world, upon the best terms you can. This is the
only chance you have for salvation. It must come to this
very soon; otherwise, there will be a total dissolution of
the British Empire.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, April 24th, 1780.</p>
<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There is intelligence from Stockholm of the 4th of this
month, that "the Envoy Extraordinary of the Empress of
Russia has given notice to that Court, of the declaration
made by his sovereign, as well to the States-General of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the United Provinces as to the powers actually at war,
demanding, at the same time, that Sweden would accede
to it, and to this end join herself to Russia, by augmenting
the Swedish marine, to the end, to concur by this means,
in the maintenance of a neutrality. Although this Court
appears very well inclined to enter into the views of Russia,
nevertheless, it is thought, that before anything will be
decided upon this object, she will previously give notice of
it to the Court of France. In the meantime, the Minister
of Russia at this Court has received orders to treat directly
of this affair, as well with the Prince de Gallitzin,
Envoy Extraordinary of her Imperial Majesty to their
High Mightinesses, as with the other Ministers of that
Court residing at the neutral Courts."</p>

<p>There is also intelligence from Ratisbon of the 13th
of April, that "M. Struxe, Counsellor of the Legislation
from Russia, has communicated there by order of his
Court the declaration made by his sovereign to the belligerent
powers, to the end to make her flag be respected,
and to protect the commerce and navigation of her subjects;
and that, in consequence, orders had already been
despatched to Cronstadt and Archangel to equip there a
sufficient number of ships of the line."</p>

<p>There is a paragraph in the Gazette of Amsterdam, of
the 21st, from Paris of the 14th of April. "It is only by
conjecture, that we talk of the plan of the next campaign
in Europe; and it is also with the same uncertainty, that
we lend our ear to the report, which runs, that the Count
d'Estaing will command the combined fleet, and even,
that the Count du Chaffault, as well as the Spanish Admirals,
have offered to serve under him. It is pretended,
besides, that there may very well be also some alterations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in the progress of our Ministry, if it is true, as they continue
to affirm, that the Count de Parades has been arrested
as a spy of the English Government, to whom he was,
in fact, in a capacity to discover important particulars upon
this subject. But there is another piece of news, to which
we give more credit, because, really, there is no good citizen,
nor genuine friend of humanity, who does not wish to
hear it confirmed. It is, that there should be, as it is said,
upon the carpet, a plan concerted between all the maritime
powers of Europe, to the end to form and digest a universal
code for the sea, the laws of which no nation
should attempt to infringe, without devoting herself to the
indignation, or exposing herself to the vengeance, of all
the others; an important project, if it could be executed,
which would insure the happiness and tranquillity of
nations, and would set bounds, which could not be passed,
to the audacity, as well as the avarice of any one, which,
without any other right than that of force, should pretend
to arrogate to itself the exclusive empire of the sea."</p>

<p>There is also intelligence from the Hague of the 19th
of April, that there was sent on the 14th of the month to
the Assembly of the States-General of the United Provinces,
a Memorial of the following tenor.</p>

<p>"Their Noble and Grand Mightinesses, the Commissioners
of the affairs of commerce and navigation, conjointly
with some counsellors of Holland, and Ministers of
the College of Admiralty residing in this Province, having,
in consequence of a resolution of the 4th of this
month, examined the Memorial presented the day before
to the Generality, by the Prince Gallitzin, Envoy Extraordinary
of her Majesty, the Empress of all the Russias,
by which the Minister has communicated a declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
made by his sovereign to the Courts of France, Spain,
and England, that the neutral powers may protect by
common agreement the commerce and navigation of her
subjects respectively, as is more fully explained in the
note of the 4th of April.</p>

<p>"Whereupon having deliberated, their Noble and Grand
Mightinesses have thought fit and resolved, that the affairs
be proposed to the Generality, and that they answer in
turn to the before mentioned Memorial of the Prince de
Gallitzin, that their High Mightinesses have received, with
much satisfaction, the communication, which it has pleased
her Majesty, the Empress of Russia, to give them of her
designs, as well as of the declaration, which she has caused
to be made to the said Courts; that their High Mightinesses
regard this communication as the most convincing
proof of the benevolence of her Majesty for this Republic,
and holding themselves honored by it, they think themselves,
consequently, obliged in all respects to give her a
cordial and positive answer; that their High Mightinesses
put the highest value on the new proof, which her Imperial
Majesty gives on this occasion of her generosity and acknowledged
equity, as well as on the project she has conceived,
and the means which she has resolved to employ
to obtain the most exact neutrality in the present war with
the belligerent powers, and protect not only the honor of
the Russian flag, as well as the commerce and navigation
of her subjects, in not permitting them to be disturbed by
any of the powers at war, but also to assure the liberty and
repose of Europe upon the solid foundations of the justice
of the law of nations and the treaties subsisting, and thus to
consolidate the equitable system of navigation and commerce
of the neutral powers; that their High Mightinesses having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
nothing more at heart, than to observe a strict neutrality
with her Majesty, the Empress of Russia, in the present
war, but instructed by experience, in the losses which the
commerce and navigation of the neutral powers have
suffered, by the fluctuations and uncertainty of the belligerent
powers in the state of the law of nations, from whence
have resulted to them many inconveniences and great
damages occasioned by the operations of the present war,
their High Mightinesses have judged it necessary, in concert
with her Majesty, the Empress of Russia, to fix this
law upon a solid basis, and to request, for this end, the
concurrence of the neutral maritime powers; that, moreover,
as to what concerns the extent and limits of this law,
their High Mightinesses conform themselves wholly to the
five points contained in the declaration of her Imperial
Majesty made to the Courts of Versailles, Madrid, and
London, communicated to their High Mightinesses by the
Prince de Gallitzin the third of April of this year, and are,
consequently, ready to make similar declarations to the
belligerent powers, their High Mightinesses being sincerely
disposed to enter into conferences with her Imperial
Majesty of all the Russias, and other neutral maritime
powers, upon the measures which may be unanimously
taken, to the end to maintain effectually, both for the
present era and for the time to come, the liberty of navigation
and commerce, by observing an exact neutrality between
the belligerent powers.</p>

<p>"That the extract of the resolution to be taken be sent
by the Agent, Van den Burch Spuonings, back to the
Prince de Gallitzin, Envoy Extraordinary of her Imperial
Majesty of all the Russias, to the end to inform his sovereign,
and to employ his good offices to lay before her this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
answer in the manner the most favorable; that they
ought also to send a similar extract to M. de Swart, Resident
of their High Mightinesses at the Court of Petersburgh,
for his information, with an injunction to co-operate,
as far as shall depend upon him, to the success of the salutary
intentions of their High Mightinesses; that the same
measures be taken with regard to the Ministers of the Republic
at the Courts of Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Lisbon,
with orders to act in concert, and to support the
measures of the Russian Ministers at the Courts where
they reside."</p>

<p>Their High Mightinesses having deliberated upon this
object, the Deputies of Provinces, which have not as yet
declared themselves, have been desired to pronounce as
soon as possible the resolutions of the States, their principals.
The States of the Province of Groningen have declared
themselves authorised, during the suspension of the
deliberations, to confer on this subject with the Prince de
Gallitzin for a further explanation, saving the free deliberations
of their principals.</p>

<p><em>Amsterdam, 20th of April.</em> The College of Admiralty
of West Friesland and of the northern quarter have put in
commission, with the participation of His Most Serene
Highness, the Prince Stadtholder, the frigates of war, the
Medemblick, of thirtysix guns, the Horn, Enkhuisen, of
twenty guns, which will be commanded by the Captain
Van Regneveld Heckers and Trykenius."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, April 25th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>A letter from Dublin, of the 18th of this month, gives us
the following account. "We wait with impatience for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
meeting of Parliament; the day approaches when the
political destiny of this kingdom will be decided. There
is yet some softness in one party of the Parliament, but
there is none at all in the body of the people, and especially
in that of our brave volunteers, who are at once the
admiration and the firm hope of the nation, which seems now
to spring up, and out of chaos. One thing very extraordinary
is, that among this body of volunteers, exceeding
in fact the number of fortysix thousand men, (although
in so innocent an army composed of so many discordant
parties, commanded by so many chiefs, some more
powerful than the others might be suspected of entertaining
views a little opposite to patriotism,) no ambitious
ones, supported by popularity, have undertaken anything,
not only against the liberties, but even against the tranquillity
of the people; not the least disorder, not even the
appearance of disunion, or partial cabals. We contemplate
with astonishment, mixed with a joy most intimately
felt, an armed multitude proceeding to give, so to express
myself, the island to the civil power, and aiding it to protect
and facilitate the execution of its laws. Such are the
advantages, which we ought always to provide ourselves
from an army, the humblest soldier of which finds his interest
in good order and good government. Mercenaries
fight for money; volunteers, proprietors of one part of the
lands, which are proposed to be defended, and of the
rights, which are to be recovered or protected, have a
direct interest in preserving in all their vigor the laws,
which assure to them the property of those lands, and
the enjoyment of these rights.</p>

<p>"While the nation busies itself about its political emancipation,
and already enjoys it, by anticipation, she does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
neglect the advantages already obtained by the firmness and
the wisdom of her conduct; all the objects of commerce
fix the attendance of various committees; the establishments
are multiplied insensibly in proportion to the rising
occasions; where there were manufactories they are busied
about the means of improving them, where there were
none, and it appears convenient to establish them, societies
of adventurers are formed. We have a considerable
number of woollen stuffs and cloths, we have none of cotton.
At this day Limerick proposes to become the rival
of Manchester; they are about making the beautiful velvets,
and stuffs of cotton. One company have appropriated
to this undertaking a capital of sixteen thousand pounds
sterling, and they have brought over from England a
sufficient number of excellent workmen in this business.</p>

<p>"In reading over my letter, I remark I have stated at fortysix
thousand the number of volunteers actually armed
among us; we have not yet an exact return, it is possible
there may be four or five thousand more, because at
the end of last year we generally reckoned upon fortyfive
thousand, and there have been since formed five new
corps, commanded by officers as respectable for their personal
courage, as for their patriotism. If this martial ardor,
which animates all the orders of the community, has any
inconvenience, it is, that it takes away from the manufacturers
a prodigious number of hands. Independently of
the time given to military exercise, you would not be able
to conceive how many people are employed in these melancholy
but necessary manufactures, which have no other
use, end, or object, than the destruction of men. The
casting of cannon, the manufacture of arms of every description,
of tents, and other articles, which are required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
for the preparation for a campaign, employ moreover several
thousands of hands; it is true, that the two levies
divide the labor between them.</p>

<p>"They say, that the Duke of Leinster, on whom they had
so unjustly ventured to publish some offensive reflections,
has declared publicly and in the most solemn manner, that
he will support the people in the vindication of their rights
to a free constitution absolutely independent. If the serenity
of our present situation is sometimes interrupted, it
is by those unlucky white boys, who, from time to time,
renew their atrocities. The 1st instant fifty of these banditti
well mounted met upon an eminence at Cloriseu, near
to Feathard, where they conducted themselves in an inhuman
manner towards two individuals."</p>

<p>In the French Gazette is an article from London with
regard to Ireland. "They accuse the Ministry of holding
relative to that kingdom the same conduct, which they held
in the beginning of the troubles of America, that is to
say, to leave the sovereign and the nation in error, concerning
all the facts, and endeavor to inspire into the British
Parliament the most sinister carelessness and inattention
for the most important of affairs. People hired to
support among us the blindest confidence write, that the
Irish are very well pleased with Lord Hillsborough, that
the concessions made to Ireland satisfy all its wishes, that
even the associations enjoy in peace the good that has
been done to their country. We learn, however, that the
city of Dublin declares in her common council, that she
cannot any longer suspend her judgment upon the conduct
of government, that to destroy the false interpretations,
which they have endeavored to give to the joy, which the
people of Ireland have testified upon the subject of the act,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which gives liberty to their commerce, several counties,
and the greatest part of the associations, have thought
themselves obliged to explain to the public, that the motive
of this momentary joy proceeded principally from this,
that they regarded the liberty of commerce as a commencement
of the independence of the constitution.</p>

<p>"The principal creatures of the English Ministry, in the
Parliament of Ireland, arrived the beginning of this month
to receive instructions relative to the approaching Assembly,
but they say, that during their absence the chiefs of
the national party have been employed in promoting the
meetings of the counties, in cementing the military associations,
and encouraging the people to insist upon a declaration
of rights, so that nothing is yet finished in that
respect. Mr Yelverton proposes to make a motion in the
House of Commons, that a sum shall be voted sufficient to
build four strong frigates, which shall constantly cruise
upon the coasts of this kingdom to protect merchant fleets
and convoys. This project announces but too plainly the
design of Ireland to separate herself from us as much as
she can, and to owe her safety only to herself. With what
view should England insist still with the Irish upon the pretension
of supremacy? In renouncing the advantages,
which the monopoly of commerce procured, she has destroyed
the only obstacle, which could oppose itself to the
independence of Ireland."</p>

<p>There is in the Leyden Gazette of the 21st another
article from London. "The Earl of Bellamont, who arrived
here the 5th of this month from Ireland, has had an
audience of his Majesty, and several conferences with his
Ministers; as this nobleman is one of the principal supporters
of the party of the administration in that country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
it is supposed that his journey here was occasioned by the
crisis, in which affairs are there at this time. Mr Henry
Flood, who has come to Court on the same subject, as
well as Mr Seaton Perry, the speaker of the Irish Commons,
and Sir Richard Heron, Secretary of the Lord
Lieutenant, have on the contrary returned to Dublin. As
the Parliament was to sit the 10th of this month, we expect
immediately interesting advices concerning the turn,
which affairs may have taken there, and so much the more
as we know, that soon after the meeting, Mr Yelverton intended
to propose a bill, declaratory of the rights of Ireland,
as far as they respect Poyning's law, and the manner
of passing Irish bills in England. In the meantime, the
leaders of the two parties endeavored to increase their
forces in the two houses, although the preponderance in
favor of the Court would scarcely have any effect, in case
the party the most considerable of the people remain in
the sentiments they appear to be in at this day. This consideration
they say, supported by the advice of Sir Richard
Heron, Mr Seaton Perry, and Mr Flood, has determined
our government to give way to the wishes of the Irish
nation, by consenting to the revocation of Poyning's law, if
there are no other means of assuaging the fermentation of
spirits. It is true, that some cities, counties, and boroughs,
have lately assured the government of their attachment,
and of their gratitude for the favors granted to Ireland, but
there is a great deal wanting before all the people will be
equally satisfied. The most enlightened part of the nation
regard these same favors as granted to necessity, and purely
precarious as long as the British legislature shall have
the right to make laws for Ireland. Some magistrates have
even already refused to execute the laws passed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Parliament of Great Britain; those of the county of Mayo,
having been among others required to put in force the act
against desertions, and to show that they acknowledge no
others than those, which have been made by their own legislative
body. In general, according to the last accounts received
from that country, it appears, that of the four parts
of Ireland, the provinces of Leinster and Connaught are
the most tranquil, reposing themselves upon the assurances,
which have been given them by the respective Colonels of
their volunteer associations, the Duke of Leinster, and the
Earl of Clanricarde; and that the Court is disposed to grant
to the nation all its demands. In the province of Munster,
they are less quiet, and they persuade themselves, that
there is little dependence upon a momentary benevolence,
which is due only to necessity. But the inhabitants of
Ulster are, of all Ireland, those who appear the most firmly
determined to procure to themselves, at any price, an entire
independence of the British legislation, and the formal renunciation
of all acts, which are contrary to it. As this
province, where they reckon at least thirty thousand families
of Protestants, more than all the rest of the kingdom,
distinguishes itself by the courage of its inhabitants, they
will risk a great deal if they stir up discontents there."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, April 26th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>At last, even the Morning Post of the 18th of April
confesses, that the Memorial from the Empress of Russia
to the States-General has dissipated all their golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dreams of an alliance with the Czarina. It was announced
to us last week, that a Russian squadron had left Cronstadt
to sail to our assistance, nay, some of the public papers
went so far as to announce their arrival at Plymouth.
How sadly are we now disappointed! Instead of an alliance,
we find her <em>Czarish</em> Majesty talks of neutrality, so
that at present it is pretty clear, that the various powers in
Europe seem determined to stand off, and leave us to our
fate."</p>

<p>In some confused minutes of a debate in the House of
Lords on the 14th of April, it is said, that Lord Camden
expressed his astonishment and regret at the Memorial
from Russia, in which, contrary to the established law of
nations, the Empress insisted upon free ships and free
goods. He pointed out how injurious to the country it
must be, if neutral vessels were permitted to supply our
enemies, whom we might blockade, with everything they
might want, and remarked, that the queen of the seas was
now deposed, and the Empress had taken possession of
her throne. In another paper, Lord Shelburne is represented
remarking the very dangerous and alarming situation
they stand in, with regard to their wars and foreign alliances.
"Of the former," said his Lordship, "we have three,
of the latter none, even the Empress of Russia, that great
potentate, who was constantly held out by the noble Lord
with the green riband, (Lord Stormont,) to be our principal
ally, now shows to all Europe by her late maritime
manifesto, what sort of an ally she means to be to England.
The thought of that manifesto made him shudder
when he first read it, particularly, as he knew how this
country stood in respect to other powers, when Denmark
must follow wherever Russia led, when Sweden was ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
at the nod of France; think of having the whole force of
the northern powers against us; already engaged in three
wars, and striving all we can to make a fourth with our old
friends and neutral allies, the States-General."</p>

<p>There have appeared few other reflections as yet, upon
this great event, the Russian declaration. Even the opposition
seems afraid to lay it open, in all its terrors, to the
people. They repeat the word neutrality, neutrality, but
it is as decisive a determination against them, as a declaration
of war would have been, perhaps more so, because
now there is a probability that the maritime powers will
be unanimous, whereas in the other case they might
have been divided. It is very surprising, that the peace
between Russia and the Turk, and that between the Emperor
and the King of Prussia, (in which the Empress of
Russia took a part as spirited and decided as she has upon
this occasion, in both of which negotiations the British
ministry ought to have known that Russia and France
acted in perfect concert,) should not have earlier dissipated
their golden visions, but so it is, and so it has been; England,
as Governor Pownal says, cannot or will not see. The
improvement in the law of nations, which the Empress
aims at, and will undoubtedly establish, is hurtful to England,
it is true, to a very great degree, but it is beneficial
to all other nations, and to none more than the United
States of America, who will be carriers, and I hope forever
neutrals.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, April 28th, 1780.</p>
<p class="open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>The news from Hamburg of the 11th of April is, that
"the Sieur de Geoss, the Minister of the Empress of Russia,
near the circle of the Lower Saxony, has communicated
to the Magistracy of that city a declaration, which his
Sovereign has made to the three Courts at war, for the
maintenance of the free navigation of neutrals; and we
learn, that the same notification has been made to the Regencies
of Lubec and Bremen, on the part of this Sovereign;
who, without ceasing to observe a neutrality between
the Courts actually at war, considers the liberty of the seas
as a common good of all nations, which different particulars
ought not to interrupt."</p>

<p>The news from London of the 18th of April is, "the
term of three weeks is fixed for receiving an answer to the
answer of the Memorial, which Sir Joseph Yorke has presented
to their High Mightinesses, the States-General,
expired last Thursday; they have published yesterday a
Declaration, against the United Provinces, of which here
follows the translation."</p>

<p>"The Resolution taken at a Council held at St James
the 17th of April, 1780, in presence of his Majesty. Since
Great Britain has been brought involuntarily into a war
against France and Spain, the Ambassador of the King
to the States-General of the United Provinces has presented
several Memorials for demanding the succors stipulated
by the treaties. These representations, although repeated
in the most pressing manner by the Memorial of
the 21st of March, have remained without answer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
their High Mightinesses have not manifested an intention
to oppose them. By delaying thus to fulfil engagements
the most positive, she deserts the alliance, which has
subsisted so long between the Crown of Great Britain
and the Republic, and places herself on a level with neutral
powers, which are not connected with this kingdom by
any treaty. The principles of wisdom and equity prescribe,
by consequence, to the King no longer to consider
the States but in the distant relation in which they have
placed themselves; and his Majesty having taken this
subject into consideration, has thought fit, by the advice
of his privy council, to put in execution immediately the
measures, which have been formerly annexed by the Memorial
of the 21st of March last, and which had been previously
suggested to the Count de Welderen, the Envoy
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic, by a
verbal declaration of Lord Stormont, one of the Secretaries
of State, nearly two months before the presentation of said
Memorial. For these causes the King, with the advice of
his Council, declares, that the subjects of the United Provinces
shall henceforward be considered on the footing of
neutral powers, who are not privileged by treaties. His
Majesty suspends by these presents, conditionally, and until
further order, all the particular stipulations designed to
favor in time of war the liberty of the navigation and commerce
of the subjects of the States-General, such as they
are expressed in the different treaties, which subsist between
his Majesty and the Republic, and especially in the
Marine Treaty concluded between Great Britain and the
United Provinces at London on the 1st day of December,
1674.</p>

<p>"His Majesty, animated by a sentiment of humanity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
willing to spare the interest of individuals, and not seeking
their damage by an act of surprise, declares, moreover,
with the advice of his Council, that the execution of the
present ordinances shall not take place but at the following
epochs, to wit; in the Channel and in the northern seas,
twelve days after this date; from the Channel and the
northern seas, as far as the Canary Islands, inclusively,
both on the ocean and in the Mediterranean; the term shall
be six weeks, reckoning from the date of these presents;
it shall be of three months from the Canary Islands to the
equinoctial line or the equator; and, finally, of six months
to the parts situated beyond the equator, and, in general,
in all the other parts of the world without exception, and
without any more particular determination of time or
place."</p>

<p><em>Hague, April the 23d.</em> The Report of the Committee
of the Province of Groningen, confirmed by the approbation
of the States of the same Province, has been presented
to the Assembly of their High Mightinesses. Here follow
the contents.</p>

<p class="open">
"Noble and Mighty Lords,

<p>"In compliance with the resolution of your Noble Mightinesses
of the 31st of March last, in consequence of which
was presented into the hands of the Committee of your

State has not only done all that which his Britannic Majesty,
grounding himself upon the law and the treaties,
could require of the Republic, but, at the same time, has
relinquished some of the prerogatives, which incontestably
belonged to it; that, instead of experiencing on the part of
England the reciprocation of a treatment thus friendly, the
Republic has seen itself cruelly undeceived, as a great
number of ships belonging to its inhabitants have been
seized by the privateers, and even by the men-of-war of the
King of England; ships with their cargoes, or at least one
of them, declared lawful prize; violence having even been
employed on many occasions against our crews, without our
having been able to obtain the least indemnification or satisfaction
for such grievances, notwithstanding all the repeated
complaints and representations to that effect; that
the expedition of Commodore Fielding appeared to have
been made in conformity to positive orders; that thereby
the flags of the States had been notoriously insulted, and
the ships under the convoy of Commodore Byland had
been not only carried into England, but had been also there
detained, although it appeared, that their loading did not
consist in contraband goods; that this condescension, to
which the Republic was by no means obliged, had only
had disagreeable and dangerous consequences, both with
regard to Great Britain and other powers, as is proved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the considerations drawn up by the colleges of the Admiralty
respectively. The Committees of your Noble Mightinesses
would be, therefore, of opinion, that from this time
forward and for the future, we ought to take under convoy
and the protection of the State all the merchandises, which
the treaties declare not to be contraband, and that they be
so effectually protected, that we may have no further room
to fear for the future, that the least insult will be committed
against the flag of the States, and that, in one word, as
to what remains, we ought, conformably to the treaties subsisting,
to observe an exact neutrality."</p>

<p>The State of Groningen has entirely conformed to the
foregoing Report.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Second Report presented by the same Province.</em></p>

<p class="open">
"Noble and Mighty Lords,<br />
</p>

<p>"The Committees of your Noble Mightinesses, in compliance
with the Resolution of the 26th of November and
the 2d of December of the last year, as well as of the 23d
of March last, after an examination of the three Memoirs
presented by Sir Joseph Yorke, Ambassador Extraordinary
of his Britannic Majesty, on the 22d of July and the 26th
of November, 1779, and on the 20th of March last, to
their High Mightinesses, demanding, by the first, the succors
stipulated by the treaty of 1674; insisting, in the
second, on a catagorical answer; and finally complaining, in
the last, of the combat held by Commodore Byland; on
occasion of what passed with Commodore Fielding, adding
thereto, &mdash;&mdash; instances to the end to obtain before the expiration
of three weeks a satisfactory answer concerning
the succors demanded, since otherwise, his Majesty would
regard this Republic on the footing of neutral powers no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
ways favored by treaties, and would conditionally suspend
all the treaties, and particularly that of 1674, and would
treat the Republic according to the ordinary law of nations;
after having also examined several letters, and other pieces
annexed, successively transmitted by the Count de Welderen,
Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of their
High Mightinesses to His Britannic Majesty, they have the
honor to report to your Noble Mightinesses, that after
having maturely reflected upon what relates to the points
in question, their advice will be, that in answer to the said
three Memorials of Sir Joseph Yorke, Ambassador Extraordinary,
it ought to be replied,</p>

<p>"That their High Mightinesses during the troubles subsisting,
which undoubtedly drew their origin from America,
and from thence, by an ulterior extension of the war,
have spread themselves in Europe, have, by observing an
exact neutrality, giving to his Britannic Majesty the most
unfeigned proofs of their attachment and of their affection,
even beyond their obligations, by a condescension, to
which they were by no means obliged towards England,
but the consequences of which have been, besides the prejudice
thereby occasioned to the commerce and navigation
of this country, that there has arisen a marked dissatisfaction,
although by no means provoked, of the belligerent
powers; and, in particular, the preparations made at the
same time by land could not but excite the most serious
attention of their High Mightinesses, to the end that they
might, without interruption, not deprive themselves of the
means indispensably necessary, both for their own preservation
and defence, by granting the succors demanded;
that they ought rather to think of demanding themselves,
in consequence of the aforementioned treaties, the succors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which would be so necessary to them, upon the least apprehension
of the continuance of the same preparations.
That their High Mightinesses, founded upon good reasons,
as well as upon the favorable declarations of his Majesty so
often reiterated, ought to have expected a reciprocal
affection and a friendly treatment towards the Republic,
at least, that he would not have disputed a right, stipulated
clearly by the most solemn treaties, and of which, so soon
after the conclusion of the treaty of 1674, even before the
war was entirely finished, the subjects of his Majesty, to
the detriment of this country, make so free a use.</p>

<p>"Their High Mightinesses, penetrated with the most
lively grief, have nevertheless perceived, that so far from
their good intentions and proceedings having operated to
any happy effect, it has happened, on the contrary, that
several acts diametrically opposed to justice, have been
authorised and executed by connivance, under the illusory
pretext of opposition even to the same connivance,
and this, in spite of multiplied efforts employed by the Republic
to obviate such abuses; that, moreover, the rencounter
between Commodore Fielding and Commodore
Byland is of a nature, that according to the law of nations,
the flag of a sovereign power being, in fact, everywhere
sacred, the declaration made by the Count de Byland,
an officer commanding in chief a squadron in the
name of the Republic whereof he is a subject, ought to
have been regarded as authentic, and to have stopped at
once all suspicions, and destroyed the intelligence falsely
given; from whence it follows, that the said Commodore
Byland has not undertaken anything, but for the maintenance
and protection of the honor and respect due to the
flag of the State; while the seizure and detention of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ships are equally a part of those objects, concerning which,
their High Mightinesses ought also to demand a satisfaction
convenient to his Majesty, as well as a declaration unequivocal
for the time to come; adding, at the same time,
that, after a mature consideration upon the situation in
which the Republic is at present, their High Mightinesses
are perfectly acquainted with the succors demanded by
his Britannic Majesty."</p>

<p>The States of the Province of Groningen have conformed
themselves to the report before mentioned.</p>

<p><em>Hague, 22d of April.</em> "We learn that the Province
of Gueldres has determined to grant unlimited convoys,
and, at the same time, to refuse the succors demanded by
Great Britain; by means of which, the Seven United
Provinces are actually of one unanimous sentiment upon
this object."</p>

<p><em>Hague, 23d of April.</em> "We learn, that the deputies of
the Province of Holland have already been instructed to
carry to the Assembly of the States-General, the opinion of
their high constituents concerning the invitation, which the
Prince de Gallitzin, Envoy of the Empress of Russia, has
made in the name of her Majesty, to their High Mightinesses,
to protect in concert the navigation of the neuters;
and that this opinion, announced in a resolution of the
State of the Province, bearing date the 13th of April,
tends to accept the invitation in terms full of attachment
and gratitude, declaring, 'that their High Mightinesses regard
the communication, which has been made to them, as
a signal token of the benevolence of her Majesty towards
the Republic; that they honor it, and believe it to be their
duty to answer it with sincerity and cordiality; that they
consider it also as a new proof of the magnanimity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the justice of her Majesty, which are universally acknowledged,
both the end which she proposes and the measures
she has projected to maintain in the present war, a neutrality
the most rigorous between the belligerent powers,
and for protecting, not only the honor of the Russian flag,
and the safety of the commerce and navigation of her subjects,
in not permitting that any of the belligerent powers
should strike at it; but also, by establishing by her cares
the liberties and repose of Europe upon foundations the
most solid, of equity, the law of nations, and the treaties
subsisting, and to give validity to an equitable system of
navigation and of commerce in favor of the neutral
powers; that their High Mightinesses, desiring to observe
with her Imperial Majesty in the present war a scrupulous
neutrality, have but too much experienced the losses to
which the navigation and commerce of neutral nations are
exposed by the uncertain and fluctuating ideas of the belligerent
powers with regard to the rights of neuters, in
proportion as they are guided by their private interest and
by the operations of the war; that their High Mightinesses
judge with her Imperial Majesty, that it is of the last necessity
that this law should be fixed upon solid principles,
and maintained in concert by the neutral maritime powers;
that for what concerns the determination of the said right,
their High Mightinesses conform themselves entirely to the
five points contained in the declaration, which her Majesty
has made to the Courts of Versailles, Madrid, and London;
that after her example, they are ready to transmit
parallel &mdash;&mdash; to the belligerent powers, and that
they are very much disposed to enter into conferences
with her Majesty and the other neutral powers, upon the
measures by which the liberty of navigation and commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
may be maintained in concert, in a manner the most efficacious,
both for the future and for the present, observing, at
the same time, an exact neutrality among the belligerent
powers.'</p>

<p>"The same opinion tends also to cause to be transmitted
the copy of such a resolution, not only to the Prince de
Gallitzin, Envoy of her Majesty to the Republic, but also
to M. de Swart, Resident of their High Mightinesses at
Petersburg, and to their Ministers at the Courts of Copenhagen,
Stockholm, and Lisbon, with orders to these last to
second, as far as possible, the proceedings of the Court of
Russia, and to act in concert with the Ministers of her
Imperial Majesty, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Congress will be able to draw just inferences from these
important papers of State.</p>

<p>The principle, which the English contend for, has no
other foundation but the insular situation of Great Britain,
and the convenience of that nation. The principle, which
the neutral powers are contending for, is evidently laid in
the common good of nations; in the ease, safety, convenience,
happiness, and prosperity of mankind in general.
But we shall see, whether obstinacy and fierce passions
will, at length, give way in one instance. At present there
is no appearance of it. On the contrary, I see no way for
the English to escape a war with Holland and Russia,
Denmark and Sweden, and, perhaps, Portugal, unless they
should be interrupted in their career by a war with one
another at home.</p>

<p>When, where, or in what manner, we shall see the unravelling
of the vast plot, which is acting in the world, is
known only to Providence. Although my mind has been
full twenty years preparing to expect great scenes, yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
confess the wonders of this Revolution exceed all that I
ever foresaw, or imagined. That our country, so young as
it is, so humble as it is, thinking but lately so meanly of
itself, should thus interest the passions, as well as employ
the reason of all mankind, in its favor, and effect in so short
a space of time, not only thirteen revolutions of government
at home, but so completely accomplish a revolution in the
system of Europe, and in the sentiments of every nation in
it, is what no human wisdom, perhaps, could foresee.</p>

Paris, April 29th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Walsingham sailed from St Helens the 8th with the
Thunderer, the Ramilies, the Berwick, and the Egmont,
of seventyfour guns, the Scarborough, of twenty, and the
fire-ships, the Blast and the Salamander; only four ships
of the line. On the 11th Admiral Graves followed him,
with the London, of ninetyeight guns, the Bedford, the
Shrewsbury, the Royal Oak, of seventyfour, the Prudent,
and the America, of sixtyfour, and the Amphitrite, of
twentyfour; these, with the four of Admiral Rodney, make
fourteen ships of the line. Admiral Parker, it is said, has
not more than nine fit for service, which will make twentythree,
supposing that Graves has the same destination.
Many people, however, believe he is going to Canada, in
order to be beforehand of the fleet of Brest, which the
English suppose has designs upon that Province. My
intelligence from London is, however, that Graves is intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for the North American station, perhaps New York
or Georgia. But the orders to Graves were so suddenly
determined on and given, that there has not yet been time
to discover with certainty his destination.</p>

<p>The accounts are, that Walsingham returned on account
of contrary winds with his numerous fleet of merchant ships
to Plymouth; that he sailed again on the 13th, and after
sailing twenty leagues, with a good wind, he returned a
second time, imagining that he saw a French fleet of men-of-war.
The winds have been generally contrary since,
and we have not yet a certain account of his sailing a third
time.</p>

<p>The principal officers named for the command of the
English fleet in the English Channel, are Sir Charles
Hardy, Admiral of the White, Commander in Chief; Vice
Admiral, Admiral Barrington, of the Blue, second; Vice
Admiral Darby, of the Blue, third; and Rear Admiral
Digby, of the Blue, fourth.</p>

<p>The next day after the departure of the fleet of Commodore
Walsingham, the London, of ninetyeight guns,
commanded by Admiral Graves, the Shrewsbury, the
Royal Oak, of seventyfour, the America, the Prudent, of
sixtyfour, and the Amphitrite, of twentyfour, having set
sail from St Helens, and the Resolution as well as the
Invincible of seventyfour, intended as part of the squadron,
the crews of the two last vessels refused to sail until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
should be paid their wages, and have received their shares
of the prize of the Protée. The eleventh of the month, the
Resolution, Commodore Ogle, set sail to join Admiral
Graves, the crew having at length consented to serve, when
they saw their ship surrounded by other vessels, ready to
fire upon her by order of Lord Longford. The crew of
the Invincible had more obstinacy, and Admiral Pye was
forced to send on board the Captains Balfour, Duncan,
Holt, and Barkner, to persuade them to return to their
duty. These officers called up upon deck the mutinous
sailors, whom they harangued, and to whom they represented,
that the act of Parliament, to regulate the payment
of wages on board the men-of-war, did not authorise them
to require more than one month's advance. They did
not however submit, and the captains having observed,
that among them there were, above all, four more remarkably
obstinate, sent them to the Admiral, who put them in
irons. The next day the Admiral ordered Captain Faulkner
to tell his people, that if they would submit, he would
restore the four men whom they had arrested. This
proposition was not listened to, and it was not until the
14th, that Rear Admiral Graves set sail from St Helens,
without this last vessel.</p>

<p>The Admiralty has sent orders to Portsmouth for a
court martial upon the most mutinous of the crew of the
Invincible, and it is expected, that as examples, some of
them must lose their lives.</p>

<p>I have before informed Congress of a resolution of the
County of York against the American war. This has
been since repeated by the freeholders of the County of
Surry, at a meeting held at Epsom the 14th of April. Mr
Nicholls, in an able speech, proposed the following resolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which was unanimously adopted. "That the American
war originating from the corrupt influence of the
Crown, and the ill founded assertions of the King's Ministers
in Parliament, is the cause of the present calamitous
situation of this country." This resolution was unanimously
adopted. He then recommended a second resolution
similar to that of the freeholders of Yorkshire, condemning
the continuance of offensive operations in America,
which was likewise carried unanimously.</p>

<p>Mr Budgen then moved a third resolution for thanking
those members of Parliament, who had uniformly reprobated

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 2d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the twentysixth of April the Duc de Vauguyon,
Ambassador of His Most Christian Majesty to the States-General,
presented a Memorial to their High Mightinesses,
announcing the abolition of the duty of fifteen per cent, to
which the greatest part of Dutch merchandises had been
subject on their entering into France, as well as the resolution
of the Council of State, taken upon this subject. The
following are the contents of the Memoir and the Resolution.</p>

<p class="open">
"High and Mighty Lords,
</p>

<p>"The political system of the King is essentially founded
upon the invariable principles of justice and moderation.
His Majesty has given the most unequivocal proofs of it
from the beginning of the troubles, which have arisen between
him and the King of England, in pre-engaging all
the neutral powers, by the display of a disposition the most
favorable to their prosperity, and by proposing to them no
other conditions than those of the most absolute impartiality.
His Majesty saw himself, with the most sincere regret,
obliged not to acknowledge this character in the resolution
of the States-General, of the 19th of November,
1778, by which your High Mightinesses suspended the
effects of your protection, relative to one branch of commerce,
the liberty of which was assured to you by the
public laws of equity, and the most precise stipulations of
treaties. The King then instructed me to announce to
your High Mightinesses, that if you determined thus to
make the sacrifice of one part of your rights to his enemies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
his Majesty could not preserve to your subjects the
advantages conditionally promised by his last regulation,
nor the ancient favors, which their commerce enjoyed in
his States, and which are not the result of any treaty, but
of a hereditary benevolence and affection. Your High
Mightinesses assured his Majesty with earnestness, that you
were decided to observe the most exact neutrality during
the continuance of the troubles between France and
England. But if you announced, that the act, which suspended
the effects of the efficacious protection of the Republic
in favor of ships loaded with ship timber, ought to
be regarded as in force until it should be afterwards confirmed,
you declared at the same time, that all discussion
upon this matter ought to be suspended, until after the deliberations
which were to ascertain the convoys.</p>

<p>"His Majesty not perceiving in this new disposition, any
real alteration of intention, thought that he could not avoid
setting bounds to the advantages granted in the different
parts of his kingdom to the Dutch commerce, whilst your
High Mightinesses continued to suspend, in favor of the
enemies of his Crown, the exercise of the rights the most
solidly established; but he was pleased to preserve them to
the different members of the Republic in proportion as they
adopted a system, which at the same time that it is conformable
to his views is essentially just. He has applauded
the remonstrances of your High Mightinesses to the
Court of London, and the efforts which you have made to
recover the means of restoring to the flag of the United
Provinces its ancient consideration, as well as the positive
order, which you have given to a squadron, to hold itself
ready to convoy and protect all vessels loaded with objects
not comprehended among merchandises of contraband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
from the time that unlimited convoys should be resolved
on, and he has constantly desired, that your High Mightinesses
would cease to lay obstacles in the way of the testimonies
of his affection, by attaching yourselves entirely
to the fundamental principles of your interest, informed of
your definitive intentions, in this regard, and assured of the
explanation, which your High Mightinesses are determined
to make of their neutrality, by granting an efficacious and
indefinite protection to the commerce and navigation of
your subjects. His Majesty has heard with pleasure the
several representations, which several members of the
Union, and especially the Prince, who is at the head of
the Republic, have made to him relative to the restraints,
which the commerce of different Provinces experiences in
the ports of his kingdom, and his Majesty has ordered me
to declare to your High Mightinesses, that he has revoked
by a decree of his Council, of the 22d of April, 1780, an
authentic copy of which I have the honor to present, those
of the 14th of January, the 27th of April, the 5th of June,
and the 18th of September, 1779, but he would not confine
himself to re-establish thus the subjects of your High
Mightinesses, in the enjoyment of favors, which they experienced
before the publication of those new laws; in
all the advantages conditionally promised by his regulation,
concerning the commerce and navigation of neuters, he
would give them a signal proof of his benevolence, and
he orders me to declare to your High Mightinesses, that
he has ordered the return of all the sums received by the
overseers of his Farms, in virtue of the said decrees, he
flatters himself, that testimonies so important of his affection,
will convince your High Mightinesses, not only that
he takes an interest the most sincere in the prosperity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the United Provinces, but also that justice, moderation and
beneficence form the essential and invariable basis of his
conduct and of his proceedings."</p>

<p>Decree of the King's Council of State of the 22d of
April, mentioned in the foregoing Memorial.</p>

<p>"The King, being informed of the dispositions made by
the States-General of the United Provinces for complying
with the reciprocity required by his regulation of the 26th
of July, 1778, concerning the navigation of neutral vessels,
and his Majesty, willing in consequence of these same
dispositions to give a new proof of his affection to the said
United Provinces, is determined to put an end to the restraints,
which the commerce of their subjects have experienced
in his States, to which end, the report being heard,
the King being in his Council, hath ordained, and ordains
as follows.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article I.</span> His Majesty has revoked and revokes
the decree of his Council of the 14th January, 1779,
which subjected to a duty of freight the vessels of the said
subjects of the States-General of the United Provinces of
the Low Countries; those of the 27th of April and 5th
of June, 1779, which establish a new tariff for the objects
proceeding from their growth, fishery, manufacture, and
commerce, and that of the 18th of September, 1779,
which prohibits the entry of the cheeses of North Holland
in the kingdom.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article II.</span> His Majesty confirms, in favor of the
said subjects of the States-General of the United Provinces
of the Low Countries, the advantages conditionally
promised by the dispositions of his regulation of the 26th
of July, 1778, concerning the navigation of neutral vessels
in time of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>"<span class="smcap">Article III.</span> His Majesty, willing to give to the said
subjects of the States-General a signal proof of his beneficence,
has ordained and ordains a restitution of the sums
of money received by the overseers of his Farms, in virtue
of the decrees before mentioned.</p>

<p>"Done in the King's Council of State, the 22d of April,
1780."</p>

<p>The news from the Hague of the 26th of April is, "that
the deliberations of the different Provinces, which compose
the Republic, have been continued these last weeks without
interruption, and all the opinions are unanimously
agreed upon three important objects, which make the matter
of them, viz. First, the succor demanded by Great
Britain; secondly, the convoys to be granted to merchant
ships; thirdly, the invitation of the Empress of
Russia to accede to an armed neutrality. The respective
States of the seven Provinces have all been of opinion,
first; to excuse themselves from giving the succors demanded.
Secondly; to grant convoys to all merchant
ships bearing the flag of the Republic, whatever may be
their cargoes, without any other exception than that of
contraband regulated by treaties. Thirdly; to accept
with gratitude the invitation, and to enter upon this subject
into negotiation, with the Prince de Gallitzin, Envoy Extraordinary
of Her Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p>"We learn, even that the States-General have already
taken resolutions conformable to this opinion. The affair
of the attack of the convoy, commanded by the Count de
Byland, does not less engage the attention of the government
of the Republic. The States of the Province of
Holland and of West Friesland have already formed
upon this subject the instruction, which they have directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
their deputies to carry to the Assembly of their High
Mightinesses; it tends, in substance, to represent to the
Court of London, 'that their High Mightinesses are by no
means satisfied with the answer of Lord Stormont, given
the 16th of March, to the just representations of their
High Mightinesses concerning the violence done to their
convoy, inasmuch as this answer only serves to cast upon
them, by strained arguments, the blame of that which happened,
and to represent, against all truth, their officer as
having been the aggressor. That their High Mightinesses,
as well to justify themselves in the eyes of all
Europe, as to convince, if it is possible, Great Britain,
have thought it their duty to represent further, that naval
stores not being merchandises of contraband according to
the express letter of the treaties, their visitation and detention,
made by order, especially under the flag of their
High Mightinesses, is a direct attack of their flag, as well
as of their independence and sovereignty. That, as to the
allegation of the treaty of 1674, made by Lord Stormont,
concerning the visit of merchandises suspected, the contrary
of what he advances appears in a manner the most
evident, by the simple reading of the treaty. That the
nature of a convoy rendering all visits unnecessary, the
articles fifth and sixth of this treaty confine themselves
manifestly to single ships, from which, nevertheless, they
cannot in this require more than the exhibition of their
sea letters, and with regard to vessels detained for an
enemy's port, that of their passports; that thus the conduct
of Commodore Fielding, approved by his Majesty,
implies an open violation of this treaty; by consequence,
neither the orders of their High Mightinesses, nor the act
of their officer charged with their execution, having done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
any injury to the treaties, nor any hostilities having been
committed on their part, but Commodore Fielding having
employed, for the execution of his orders, the force of
arms against the convoy of the Republic, there does not
exist the least cause of complaint on the part of his Majesty;
but on the part of their High Mightinesses, they
have had the most just reason of complaint, and that they
ought to insist still (as their High Mightinesses do insist,
in the manner the most serious,) upon a satisfaction and a
suitable reparation, as well as upon the release, without
further form of process, of the merchant ships and their
cargoes sailing under the convoy of the Republic, detained
by force and violence contrary to the tenor of treaties, and
condemned by the Judge of the Court of Admiralty with
the same injustice, with which they were attacked by Commodore
Fielding, taken, and carried into England. That
conformably to these principles, the Count de Welderen
shall be charged to give a reply to Lord Stormont, and to
support it the most effectually, as often as he shall judge it
to be further useful, &amp;c.'</p>

<p>"If, on one side, the desire of the Republic to preserve
an exact impartiality in the present troubles of Europe,
draws upon her the displeasure of Great Britain, on the
other side, she sees an end put to those restraints which
France had laid on her commerce.</p>

<p>"The Royal College of the Admiralty of Stockholm, has
sent to all the agents and consuls, who reside in foreign
countries, an ordinance, by which it is announced to all
masters of Swedish ships, that necessary convoys would be
given for the protection of the commerce of the subjects of
this kingdom."</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary for me to observe to Congress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that all these political and maritime commotions tend either
to peace, or to the full employment of all the forces of
our enemy, and, consequently, to our liberty and tranquillity.</p>

<p>The general run of speculations and of conversation
throughout Europe is upon peace. It seems the general
opinion, that Great Britain will not venture upon so many
dangers as lie all around her. I wish I could bring myself
to think so, but I confess I cannot as yet. Signal success
on the part of the allies might compel them to it; but
signal success in favor of the English would urge them
giddily on, no one can say to what lengths.</p>

<p>There is a speculative article from Brussels, the 25th of
April, that is worth transmitting to Congress. "The news
from Holland speaks of nothing but the sensation, which
the declaration of Russia has produced. The greatest
part of the Provinces, which have already given their opinions
upon the Memorials of Sir Joseph Yorke, to excuse
themselves from furnishing England with the succors demanded,
have been eager to declare, that the proposition of
the Court of Russia could not be more advantageous than in
the present circumstances, and that it ought to be accepted.
The English party is very much disconcerted by this
event, which brings forward a new order of things; this
party strives to excite a fear, that the difference of the principles
established by particular treaties among the neutral
powers respectively and the belligerent powers, will form an
obstacle to the execution of a plan so salutary, which may
serve forever as a rule in this matter. We know, that
among the belligerent powers, France has always thought
that it was just to leave a freedom of navigation to neutral
powers; it is well known, that she has a long time respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this liberty, and that if she has afterwards made regulations,
which restrain that of Holland, it was because she
has been forced to it, because it was very natural that
she should seek to stop the vessels bound to the ports of
England, when this nation made no scruple to stop those
which were bound to hers. And it is well known, too, that
she never took his part until after she had employed the
method of representation to determine the Hollanders to
protect their own commerce.</p>

<p>Spain appears equally determined to use no more methods
of rigor and severity towards the vessels of the Republic.
There is only England, who appears to oppose
the general wish, and she ought to perceive, that it is her
own conduct, which has brought forth the events of which
she complains. If she had had more moderation and justice,
the project of an armed neutrality would not have
taken place.</p>

<p>They write from Holland; "We flatter ourselves, that
the armed neutrality may contribute to accelerate peace.
It appears hitherto, that it is England alone, which puts an
obstacle to it, and it is difficult for her to take her part in
it. We doubt not that the independence of America,
which perhaps is already tacitly acknowledged by all the
Courts of Europe, will be the fundamental basis of an accommodation.
England at the same time will be forced
to announce a pretended pre-eminence of flag, equally contrary
to the laws of nations, and to the first notions of common
sense. The general liberty of the seas, the re-establishment
of the respective possessions in the State in which
there were before hostilities, perhaps the restitution of Gibraltar
to its natural masters, and the adoption of the maritime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
code proposed by Russia, will be most probably the
necessary consequences of the peace."</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 3d, 1780.
</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The substance of a cartel for a general exchange of
prisoners, made upon the sea between France and England,
has been published; it was signed at Versailles the
12th of March last, by M. le Hor, one of the principal
clerks of the office of the Marine, authorised to this purpose
by the King, and at London the 28th of the same
month, by Messrs John Bell, Walter Farquharson, P.
Corbett, and Robert Lulman, Commissioners of the King
of England. This treaty, equally useful to the two nations,
dictated by sentiments, which do honor to the powers at
war, and to humanity, will it is said be distinguished by
the true philosophers, who prefer a useful operation to
folio volumes, which talk of morals and humanity. The
most perfect equality and reciprocity is established.</p>

<p>"The prisoners shall be exchanged man for man, according
to their rank and qualities, or for a certain number
of men as equivalent, or for certain sums of money in form
of ransoms. A French Vice Admiral shall be exchanged
against an English Admiral, having command; a Lieutenant
General against an Admiral carrying his flag at &mdash;&mdash;.
A Vice Admiral, commanding a squadron, against a Rear
Admiral; the Captains of ships commanding divisions, or
having the rank of Brigadiers against Commodores; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Captains of ships having the rank of Colonels against Post
Captains of three years standing, whose rank answers to
that of Colonels; the Lieutenants of vessels commanding
frigates, from twenty to fifty guns, and having the rank of
Lieutenant Colonels against all other Post Captains who
have the same rank; the Lieutenants of vessels of the rank
of Majors against the Masters and Commanders, or Captains
who are not Post Captains; all the other Lieutenants
of vessels against Lieutenants without distinction; the
Captains of fire ships of the rank of Captains of infantry,
Ensigns of vessels of the rank of Captains of infantry,
Lieutenants of frigates, or Captains of pinks, on establishment
or for a campaign, and having the same rank, against
Lieutenants, and in want of these, against Midshipmen;
the Gardes du Pavillon against Midshipmen; the Marine
officers and subalterns against those of the same denomination
or of equal rank; the respective equivalent for all
the ranks in men and in money, is from sixty men, or sixty
pounds sterling, descending to pence, to two men, or two
pounds sterling; the sailors are to be exchanged man for
man, and the equivalent is one pound sterling; the same
gradation is to be observed for the officers of the Marine,
and officers of land forces serving as marines, and land
officers not serving on board the vessels, but taken at sea,
as well as the common soldiers. Every three months
there shall be stated accounts of exchanges, conformable
to the foregoing regulations."</p>

<p>They have also ascertained the price per head of the
transportation of prisoners, as well as of their subsistence;
they have also regulated the conditions of the exchange of
officers and other prisoners made in merchant vessels, privateers,
or others, which are not the King's ships. Passengers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
not being in the service of land or sea, when they
shall have been taken, no matter in what vessel, shall not
be regarded as prisoners, but shall be set at liberty, without
being put into the accounts of exchanges, when they shall
have proved that they are in the case of the exception.
All persons, no matter of what denomination, who shall be
shipwrecked in any vessel whatsoever, at least, if it is
not in attempting to land, or in protecting some depredation
upon the coast or in the islands of one or the other of
the two kingdoms, shall be immediately set at liberty, and
shall be furnished with the means of returning to their respective
countries, as well as with clothing, if they have
need of it, as soon as their situation shall be known, and
the measures necessary for the purpose can be taken.</p>

<h3>FROM ELBRIDGE GERRY TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, May 5th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The resolutions of Congress for calling in and cancelling
the two hundred millions of dollars emitted by them, have
in general been well received. The depreciation is stopped,
and specie, which before the passing of the Resolves,
was sold for upwards of seventy for one, is now current at
sixty, and has been lately at fiftyfive. The advantage of
this plan will be greatest to the landholder, inasmuch as
the national debt, including certificates and foreign demands,
does not now exceed five millions sterling, which
is but a trifling sum compared with the £200,000,000
sterling due from Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Another benefit resulting from it, is a supply of five millions
of dollars, of the new emission, every dollar of which
is equal to forty dollars of the old emission. Indeed this
must be called in before that can be realised; nevertheless
there is a greater demand among all ranks for continental
money, than there has been since the commencement of
the war, and specie is no longer hoarded by the disaffected
or timid.</p>

<p>With respect to our resources, Congress are at present
much in want of money, and it is a happy circumstance,
for their economy is in proportion to their wants. The
demands on the treasury are generally answered by warrants
on the several States, which are careful by some
means or other to discharge the drafts. The taxes are
rendered very heavy, but the collection goes on, and I
doubt not the army will be well fed and paid. Military
stores and clothing must, however, be procured on credit
in Europe, as well as a considerable loan to serve as a
fund for drawing on in case of necessity. Trade and privateering
are brisk, and there is a plenty of goods of every
kind excepting military, but no money to purchase them.
This is easily accounted for, since the whole sum in circulation,
as Congress have fixed it, is only five million dollars.
Our privateers and commerce have nevertheless suffered
much by the cruisers of the enemy, who have the command
of the seacoast.</p>

<p>It is much to be wished, that the Court of France would
order a squadron superior to the enemy, to be stationed in
some part of the United States, as the best and only means
of putting a speedy end to the war. It is almost impossible
to conceive the havoc, that our privateers made of the
enemy's cruisers and transports, during the time that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Count d'Estaing was at Rhode Island and Charleston. But
our losses at present nearly equal our captures. Indeed
that very worthy officer, aware of those and other advantages,
ordered the Count de Grasse to be stationed at the
Chesapeake, but his plan was defeated by the tempestuousness
of the weather. Had the latter arrived with his
squadron, Charleston would not have been besieged, and
three or four of our frigates, which are now in Ashley's
River, and will probably be destroyed, would have been
employed in intercepting the enemy's transports.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention a resolution of Congress to pay off
the continental certificates, according to the value of money
at the time of their being respectively issued. This is but
justice, and will undoubtedly be satisfactory to foreigners.
Bills of exchange are now at fortyfive for one, and will be
higher in consequence of the great risk of sending vessels
from the Eastern States to the Southern for produce.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 8th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The proceedings of the United Provinces of the Low
Countries are at this period so much attended to by mankind,
and are likely to have such extensive and lasting consequences
to us as well as to Europe, that Congress will
excuse my troubling them with them in detail, however
dry and unentertaining they may be.</p>

<p><em>Hague, April 30th, 1780.</em> "We learn that their Noble
and Grand Mightinesses, the States of Holland and West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Friesland, have taken a resolution which had been universally
adopted, and that it had been written to the Count de
Welderen, Minister of their High Mightinesses at the Court
of London, to there represent,</p>

<p>"That their High Mightinesses had been by no means
satisfied with the answer given the 16th of March, by Lord
Stormont, to the just representations made in the name of
their High Mightinesses, by M. de Welderen, their Envoy,
relative to the violences committed upon the convoy of the
Republic, inasmuch as this answer by arguments destitute
of all foundation, endeavors to cast the blame of what
happened upon their High Mightinesses, and to make the
commandant of their squadron be considered as the aggressor,
which is absolutely false; that their High Mightinesses
as well for their own justification in the eyes of all
Europe, as to convince, as far as in their power, his Britannic
Majesty of the insolidity of the answer of Lord
Stormont, and with what <em>incredible contempt of treaties</em>
their convoy has been attacked, without having on their
part provoked so hostile an action, have resolved in substance
to represent;&mdash;That their High Mightinesses, having
always held in high estimation the declaration made by his
Britannic Majesty of the sentiments of affection for the Republic,
flatter themselves that they have given his Majesty,
during the continuance of the present troubles, convincing
proofs of their esteem, and of their sincere desire to maintain
and strengthen the ties of this friendship, which for so
many years had not failed to secure the reciprocal prosperity
of the two nations; that still animated with the same
sentiments, persisting also in the same principles, and having
nothing so much at heart as the quiet and undisturbed
enjoyment of the rights, assured by the ancient treaties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
their High Mightinesses are intimately affected, that his
Majesty will consider as a provocation the necessity of that
defence to which they found themselves reduced, in consequence
of positive orders given by his Majesty himself,
and not having been able to make their representations
upon this subject attended to, see themselves obliged to
declare that they can and ought to order to be convoyed
by vessels of war, all the materials for ship building, which
shall not be transported to the succor of the enemies of his
Britannic Majesty, the said materials forming one of the
principal articles of the free navigation and of the commerce
stipulated by the treaties; but all the merchandises
of contraband being nevertheless to be excepted. That the
cargoes of materials for ship building not being considered
as contraband by the letter of the treaties, ought not to be
subjected to any visit or detention, above all when they are
found under the flag of their High Mightinesses; which,
nevertheless, has been done in consequence of orders
given upon this subject, and cannot but be regarded as a
direct and unprovoked attack of their flag, as well as of
their independence and sovereignty. That as to what
Lord Stormont advances in saying, that in virtue of the
treaty of 1674, all merchant vessels loaded with suspected
merchandises ought to be visited, to the end to excuse by
this assertion the conduct of Mr Fielding, it is but a vain
allegation, contradicted by the very words of the said treaty,
in which, in truth, there is no mention made of suspected
merchandises, but only in the third article of commodities
of contraband, which are particularly enumerated. That
the convoy, by its nature, rendering useless all visits, the
fifth and sixth articles of the said treaty of 1674, relative
to rencounters at sea, explain themselves upon the following
case. We there find literally,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
'That when any private vessel, subject to one of the
contracting powers, shall meet in open sea a vessel of war,
or other vessel provided with a commission from the other
power, and that the said vessel shall not be under convoy,
she shall not be held only barely to the exhibition of her
sea letters to justify the property of her cargo, and this in
consequence of the 8th article of said treaty, except,
nevertheless, when a merchant vessel shall be destined for
an enemy's port, she shall be obliged also to show her
passport, containing the list of effects which shall be on
board, and to show that she is not loaded with any of the
articles prohibited by the 3d article of the said treaty.'</p>

<p>"That, consequently, their High Mightinesses ought to
conclude, that the assertion of Lord Stormont concerning
the pretended exception of the said treaty, is but an extension
of a regulation which he alleges for his justification,
and that thus the conduct of Mr Fielding, approved by his
Majesty, is a blow direct and manifest struck at the same
treaty. That with regard to the property, as well as the
nature of the cargo of the vessels, which were under the
convoy of the Republic, Mr Fielding would have been
able to have abundantly informed himself by the Count de
Byland, to whom their High Mightinesses, although by no
means obliged to this act of complaisance on their part,
had given permission to consent to this demand, provided
always, that the maintenance of the rights of the subjects
of the Republic should not have suffered by it, and that,
moreover, all possible moderation should be previously
used. Their High Mightinesses could not do any other,
than approve in all its points the conduct of Count de
Byland. That thus, in contempt of all law and reason,
the vessels under convoy having been taken, and the judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the legality of their detention sent to the decision
of judges, who, as they ought not to pronounce upon this
fact but according to the regulations made by his Majesty,
are ready to declare lawful the confiscation of materials of
ship building. That notwithstanding this, no breach of
treaties having been made, either by the orders of their
High Mightinesses, or by the conduct of their officer
charged to execute them, nor any hostility committed, but,
on the contrary, Mr Fielding, in consequence of orders
which he had received, having employed the violence of
arms against the convoy of the Republic, it is not certainly
on the side of his Majesty that there ought to exist
the least right of complaint, but rather on that of their
High Mightinesses, who have subjects the most lawful on
which to make them, and to insist, in the strongest manner,
on obtaining a suitable satisfaction and reparation, as
well as the restitution of the merchant vessels and their
cargoes, which, being under the convoy of the State, have
been, against the faith of treaties, attacked and stopped by
Mr Fielding, taken and carried into England, and against
all form of justice and equity, so unjustly condemned by
the Judges of the Admiralty; and that, finally, M. de
Welderen shall be charged to conform himself to the
aforesaid instructions, to demand a positive answer upon
this subject from Lord Stormont, and to do upon this object
all that he shall judge suitable to the circumstances,
in employing to this effect his good offices and all the
efforts of the strictest duty."</p>

<p>Their High Mightinesses have also taken the following
resolution. "Having received a letter from the representative
of His Most Serene Highness, and from the directors
of the general and granted Company of the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Indies, committees of the respective chambers to the assembly
of ten, sitting at Amsterdam, written from that city
the 18th of this month, and whereof the contents are, that
in consequence of, and to the end to satisfy the resolution
of their High Mightinesses of the 12th precedent, containing
their report upon the petition of divers merchants and
proprietors of ships residing in this country, and trading
with the West Indies; shewing, thereby, to their High
Mightinesses, how it was prejudicial to the commerce and
navigation of this country;</p>

<p>'1st. That when the vessels of other European nations
transport to the Colonies of this State, situated in the
West Indies, and principally at St Eustatia, merchandises,
without paying the duties of lest and of recognition, that
the petitioners and other inhabitants of the Republic, going
from the ports of this country, were, nevertheless, obliged
to pay to the West India Company;</p>

<p>'2dly. That if the said foreign vessels should enjoy
an advantage so notable, as to transport from America,
even the merchandises and productions of the country, in
the ports of their habitation or others situated in Europe,
and without the limits of this Republic, without paying any
duty of lest or of recognition, while, nevertheless, the petitioners
see themselves not only obliged in going there and
returning to pay these duties to the West India Company,
but also to engage themselves under caution, not to return
into any port of Europe except those of this State. They
pray that a remedy may be provided for this inconvenience;'</p>

<p>"Upon which having deliberated, it has been thought
proper, conditionally, and until a final decision of their
High Mightinesses, that it should be determined by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
presents, that foreign European vessels, importing merchandise
of any sort to the islands of this State in the
West Indies, without having acquitted the sums due in this
country for the duties of lest and of recognition, shall be
subjected and obliged, after their arrival, to there pay exactly
all the duties, without exception, which the vessels of
the Republic are held to discharge before their departure
from Europe; finally, that conditionally, and until after an
ulterior disposition of their High Mightinesses, it should be
seriously forbidden to these foreign European vessels, to
load in the Colonies of the State, merchandises, except
under the same obligations and restrictions imposed upon
ships of the Republic, to wit, to sail only from, and to return
to the ports of this country, and paying the same
duties of lest, and sale, and recognition, which the ships of
the inhabitants of the State are obliged to pay, on returning
to the said ports of the Republic."</p>

<p><em>Hague, 3d of May.</em> "There has been sent to the Assembly
of their High Mightinesses, a resolution of the
Province of Gueldres, conforming wholly to that taken by
the Province of Holland, touching the memorial of the
Prince Gallitzin, and which authorises at the same time
their committees to assist at the conferences and negotiations,
to continue them, and to transmit the result of them
to the deliberations of their Noble Mightinesses, to the
end that they in course take a resolution according to the
exigence of the case, and the importance of this object.</p>

<p>"There have also been presented three resolutions of the
Province of Zealand; the first, concerning the requisition
made by the Admiralty of the quarter of the north, soliciting
a subsidy of three hundred and seventyfive thousand
florins, and to be put in a state to be able afterwards to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the annual interest of it; in consequence of which, the
States of Zealand consent to the borrowing of the said sum
upon an interest of two and a half per cent, opposing themselves,
nevertheless, to the granting to the said College an
annual subsidy, to be divided in quotas on the respective
Provinces.</p>

<p>"The second of these resolutions contains an answer to
a letter of the Admiralty on the Meuse, concerning the
indemnification of the losses suffered for the transportation
of the Ambassador Van Haefton, at Constantinople. Finally
the third resolution is relative to the Memoir of the
Prince Gallitzin, and has for its object to concur in the
opening of conferences, provided, that these do not in anything
alter the system of an exact neutrality, adopted by
the Republic, nor the treaties subsisting; with a further
insinuation to the gentlemen, their ordinary deputies, to
abstain from concurring in any final conclusion upon this
object, without the consent of their Noble Mightinesses and
without having previously informed them of what may be
projected in this respect.</p>

<p>"The States of Guilderland, in their resolution relative to
the granting of an unlimited convoy, have also declared,
that they had believed they had foundation to flatter themselves,
that the condescension of this State, upon the representations
of the King of Great Britain, to the effect to
suspend conditionally the protection due to their subjects,
and which was assured to them by the treaty of 1674,
would have sufficiently proved the desire, with which the
Republic was animated to testify to his Majesty as well as
to Great Britain, a deference the most marked, preserving
always the observation of an exact neutrality, but that
convinced of the contrary, as well by the declarations as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
by even the hostilities committed against the subjects of
the Republic, they have now thought themselves founded
in putting an end to the limitation of convoys, in granting a
free course to the protection of commerce, according to
the treaties and the law of nations. For which reason,
the aforesaid States would no more make any difficulty to
concur to maintain with the forces of the country, the
right of the Republic, lawfully acquired by solemn treaties,
but that not being, nevertheless, intimately convinced, that
in case of a further opposition the Republic is in a state of
defence sufficient upon the sea, it would consequently be
to be feared, that such a part would not serve, but to throw
the State into still greater embarrassments, and operate an
effect contrary to the end proposed. Thus then, supposing
that the high confederates should judge it indispensably
necessary to grant an unlimited convoy, the intention of
their Noble Mightinesses would not be in any degree to
retard or suspend such a resolution, but on the contrary,
to show their condescension and their desire to contribute
to the unanimity of this State, they would take away all
reflections, of what importance soever they may appear to
them, submitting themselves to the penetration of those of
the confederates, who, being more interested in navigation
and maritime commerce, have already authorised and instructed
their committees, in the generality, to consent
with the concurrence of other Provinces to an unlimited
convoy."</p>

<p>We read also in another resolution of the States of
Friesland, these remarkable words, "that the Empress of
Russia has never given a more shining proof, than in the
present conjuncture, of her attachment to this Republic,
which ought to engage the State to correspond by sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
proportioned to those, which her Majesty has discovered,
both for the well being and the safety of her own
States and subjects, and to procure to all Europe a perfect
tranquillity founded upon motives the most equitable, and
upon treaties, and to the end to prevent and hinder for the
future the damages, which commerce and navigation have
suffered until this time, and to maintain and cause to be observed
a perfect neutrality between the belligerent powers."</p>

<p>I may conclude this letter by observing, that I am informed,
they talk in Holland of laying an embargo, to prevent
the English from making many prizes, and that there
is another rumor of opening the harbor of Antwerp. If
there is any serious thought of this, it must be the fruit of
English intrigue with Austria.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 8th, 1780.
</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>At the same time that the conduct of Great Britain towards
the neutral powers is marked by a severity, that is
without example, that of France and Spain is distinguished
by a moderation and liberality, that deserves to be imitated.
I have before transmitted to Congress the declaration
of the King of France, and the decree of his Council,
abolishing the restrictions on the Holland trade. In
this letter I shall give an account of the conduct of Spain.</p>

<p>On the 13th of March, the Count de Florida Blanca
wrote a letter to the Marquis Gonzalez de Castigon, the
Minister of the Marine, to serve as a regulation for the
navigation of neuters, as follows;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"Most Excellent Lord,<br />
</p>

<p>"From the commencement of the present war with
Great Britain, the King declared sincerely, and even in a
manner that is unexampled, his intentions of blockading
Gibraltar, and his Majesty gave by me a formal notification
of it to all the foreign Ministers and Ambassadors, to the
end that they might be in a capacity to inform their respective
nations of it, and that these might avoid in their
navigation and in their conduct the consequences and procedures
authorised by the right of nations and the general
laws of war. The King declared at the same time by his
ordinances concerning privateering, published in the sight
of all the world, 'that with regard to the merchandises, productions,
and effects of the English, loaded on board of
vessels bearing the flag of a friend or a neuter, his Majesty
would conduct himself according to the procedure, which
the English should adopt towards cargoes of the same
kind, to the end to avoid by this reciprocity of conduct,
the enormous inequality, the prejudice, and even the ruin
to which the commerce and the subjects of his Majesty
would be otherwise exposed.' In spite of these dispositions
so full of equity, of frankness and good faith, the
captains and masters of neutral vessels have not ceased to
abuse without shame the impunity of their flags, whether
by sliding clandestinely into Gibraltar, with cargoes of
provisions, even with those which were destined for the
fleets and armies of the King, whether by concealing a
great part of their loading, consisting in powder and other
merchandises of contraband, or by disguising (by double
and fictitious papers, which they cast into the sea, when
they saw themselves pursued) the property of their vessels
and effects, as well as their destination for persons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
places different from those to whom they really belonged,
and to which they were bound, or whether finally by making
a formal resistance against the King's ships or his privateers,
when they endeavored to take a view of some
vessels, which they supposed neuter.</p>

<p>"Although these facts are notorious, and have been
proved by formal processes, these men, greedy of gain,
and perverse, have filled all Europe with the noise of their
clamors, propagating falsely, that orders had been given to
detain and to seize all neutral vessels, that would pass the
Straits, whilst in fact the orders were confined to the
detention of vessels suspected by their course, or their
papers, and which were loaded with provisions or effects
of the enemy, a moderation very different from the conduct
which has been held by the navy and the privateers
of England, in detaining and declaring good prize neutral
vessels, not only when they carried Spanish productions,
but of whatever kind the merchandises were, which they
had taken on board in the ports of Spain, or although they
were only bound to this Peninsula, taking also and carrying
to Gibraltar the neutral vessels, which passed in their sight
with cargoes of provisions, although the whole was but a
feint and a disguised agreement made beforehand with
persons interested in these frauds. These clamors have
been accompanied with several complaints, which have
been made to the King, filled with the exaggerations and
falsehoods beforementioned, and the complainants have addressed
themselves in the same manner to their respective
Courts, without considering, that conformably to all the
treaties of peace and of commerce the royal tribunals of
the marine of the Admiralty, as well inferior as superior,
were open to them to hear their allegations and proofs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
pronounce sentence upon the processes, which they should
institute, and repair the wrongs, which the detained vessels
should have suffered, in one case or the other, without sufficient
reason, although to this moment this point has never
been legally verified. But the captains and masters have
always obstinately insisted, that without other proofs than
their relations and their applications to the Ministry, they
should be released, and the delays and damages of their
detention made good to them, and this solely because the
clemency, the equity, and even the indulgence of the
King recommended to the judges of the marine, had set
several vessels at liberty, which had been detained with
justice, and which might have been declared good prizes,
conformably to law, and to the practice of our enemies.</p>

<p>"To dissipate even the very shadow of such like pretexts
the Count de Rechteren, Envoy of the United Provinces,
and the other Ministers of foreign Courts, were notified
beforehand, that if they proposed any means of preventing
frauds, and causes of suspicion, the King, to give a fresh
proof of the good correspondence and friendship, which he
desired to maintain with these Courts, would adopt such of
those means as should be proper to produce such an effect;
and as to this day they have not proposed nor regulated
any means of this sort, his Majesty has judged proper to
take by himself the measures, which are consistent with
his sovereignty, uniting to that end the substance of those
which have been communicated hitherto, and manifesting
in a manner, if possible, still more positive his intentions, so
full of justice, of equity, and of moderation, as being founded
upon the resolution of making them be observed with
punctuality.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article I.</span> That the vessels with a neutral flag,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
making sail through the Straits, whether on the side of the
ocean, or on that of the Mediterranean, may not be molested
nor hindered in their navigation, so long as they shall
arrange themselves, as much as shall be possible for them,
along the coasts of Africa, and keeping as far as they can
from those of Europe, during the course of their passage,
from their coming into it to their going out, provided always,
that their papers and cargoes be regular, and they
furnish no just cause to excite suspicions, whether by flying
away, or by resistance, or by an irregular course, or other
signs of correspondence with the place blocked up, or with
the ships of the enemy.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article II.</span> When the aforesaid vessels of a neutral
flag shall be destined, with their cargoes, for any ports,
situated upon the Spanish coast in the Straits, such as
those of Algeziras or Tarifa, they must lie to, and wait the
arrival of a Spanish vessel, which making sail towards them
shall give them the signal, by firing a gun, and after having
received their declaration shall escort them, or will point
out to them, according to the circumstances, the way which
they ought strictly to pursue, for coming more readily, without
any danger, and without giving cause of any suspicion,
to the place of their destination.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article III.</span> In case the Spanish vessels cruising in
the Straits, at the entrance, or the outlet, according to the
exigence of the case or the place, and conformably to the
orders, with which they may be charged, should judge it
necessary to convoy neutral vessels, which are traversing
the Straits, or even those which are coasting along Africa,
these neutral vessels shall not make opposition to submit to
the convoy, without going away from it, or furnishing
reasons of suspicion; nevertheless, as they, may arrive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
great numbers, and at different times, in such manner that
it may become prejudicial to wait for the time to be convoyed,
and that, moreover, it would be extremely embarrassing
to escort each ship in particular, they shall direct
their course conformably to the first article, towards the
coast of Africa, and shall follow it until some Spanish vessel,
stationed or cruising in the Straits, presents itself to
escort them out of sight of the place of the enemy and its
avenues; and to this end the vessels, to which the signal
shall be given, shall stop, as it was said above, and shall
conform themselves to the dispositions made in respect to
them, by producing without the smallest difficulty, or resistance,
their papers, and submitting to all that which is prescribed
by the treaties, and the common law of nations
to the end to prove the property of ships, the legality of
their documents, as well as of their cargoes and destination.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article IV.</span> When such vessels, under the appearance
of neutrals, shall come out of ports situated on the
coast of Africa, in the Straits, they shall be visited, and
treated according to the nature of their cargo, or the suspicions
which they shall have excited, of intentions to sail
to carry succors to Gibraltar, supposing always that the
vessels coming out of the said ports with the design of
going into Gibraltar, have in fact hoisted, a neutral flag and
abused it.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article V.</span> When neutral vessels shall not conform
themselves to the said dispositions, in whole or in part, in
particular cases, they shall be seized and carried into port,
where they shall be declared good prize with all their
effects and cargoes, only for being loaded with provisions,
or with those sorts of effects specified by the article 15th
of the regulation for armed vessels, without there being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
occasion for any other judicial proof; and, in case that the
articles before mentioned should not be found on board of
these vessels, the motives of their contravention of these
articles shall be juridically examined, and an account of
them rendered to his Majesty by the Secretary of State,
and of the Department of the Marine, who shall afterwards
make known the resolution of his Majesty.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article VI.</span> In case, independently of the contravention
of these articles, it should be proved that a vessel
under a neutral flag should be entered into the place, or
discovered going in (which would manifest a visible and
formal design of going there) without having lain to, or
waited for the Spanish vessel, which should have pursued
her and made her the signal, or should have gone far from
the coast of Africa, or finally, shall have separated herself
from the convoy, she shall be in all respects both in going
in and in coming out treated as an enemy's ship, declared
according to the tenor of the laws of war to be good prize,
as well as all her cargo, and all the crew shall be made
prisoners of war; because that in such a case the flag and
documents ought to be supposed false, the ship and cargo
to belong to the enemy, or that one or the other is destined
for his service.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article VII.</span> The neutral vessels, which shall be
visited by the King's ships, or privateers, upon other seas
or coasts of the ocean, and the Mediterranean, which have
no communication with the Straits of Gibraltar, shall
neither be stopped nor brought into port except in the
cases specified by the royal regulation, made the 10th of
July, 1779, for privateers; no vexation nor violence shall
be exercised against the masters of these ships, nor shall
anything be taken away from them, how small soever may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
be the value of it, under the penalty established by the
said regulation, extended even by article nineteenth to that
of death, according to the exigency of the case.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article VIII.</span> In case the vessels, stopped by the
King's ships or privateers, shall throw their papers into the
sea, and this fact shall be juridically proved, they shall, for
this reason only, be declared good prize; which has been
sufficiently made known by the sixteenth article of the
regulation for privateers, which treats of this object.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article IX.</span> If it shall be proved that in the cargoes
of vessels stopped, there should be found some effects the
property of the enemy, in such case, if the captain shall have
declared it freely, the said effects shall be unloaded alone,
the freight of them shall be paid, without retaining long the
masters or hindering in any manner their navigation, always
provided, that as far as possible the said vessels shall not
be put in a situation to run any risk by the taking out the
effects before mentioned; a receipt shall be given to the
captain for the effects discharged, of the condition they
were in, as well as the amount of their freight as far as the
place of their destination; which shall be proved by their
charter parties or documents, to the end to be able to be
satisfied, what shall be their due from the Commissary of
the Marine of the first port they shall make, that of which
they shall give notice by the way of the Ministry, to the
end that if the receipt of which they are the bearers has
been given them by a privateer, the amount of it may be
paid by the owners, and if it has been furnished them by a
King's ship, measures the most convenient in this respect
shall be taken, that in case it should be judged absolutely
necessary to conduct the said vessels into some port there
to discharge them, they may be indemnified for that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
shall be due to them, by reason of their freight, for so
many days as it shall be judged indispensably necessary
for them to take up, both in going to the said ports and
in returning; but, nevertheless, in case the captains should
conceal the effects, the property of the enemy, or deny
that they belong to the enemy, they ought to be pursued
juridically, and the Judges of the Marine shall examine
the case and decide it, with liberty of appeal to a council
of war, who, conformably to the usage of the English tribunals,
shall declare lawful prize all these effects, which
shall appear legally to belong to an enemy, by means of
which, considering the concealment and the denial of the
said effects, no account shall be made, neither of the freight
nor of the days lost to masters of vessels, since they will
have been themselves the causes of the delay occasioned
to their navigation.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article X.</span> When in the said case, or in others similar,
the ships of friends or of neutrals shall be stopped and
brought into the ports, other than those of their destination,
contrary to the forms prescribed or without having given
cause for it by well founded reasons, either by the direction
of their course, or by the state of their papers, by some
resistance on their part, the nature of their cargo, or by
other legal causes, founded either on treaties or the usages
of nations universally adopted, the armed vessels, which
shall have seized such vessels, shall be condemned to make
good the lost days as well as the damages and prejudices
caused to a seized ship; this condemnation or justification
shall be mentioned in the same sentence, which shall contain
the declarations of good or bad prize, and to this end
they shall proceed with the utmost despatch without injuring
however the privileges or principal points, whereof the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
nature of the thing requires observance, and the decisions,
whether of condemnation or acquittal, ought to be executed
under sureties, as it is regulated for the advantage of
privateers; and if it happens that the vessels, which should
have caused the damage, belong to the King, in that case
the tribunals or Judges of the Marine shall give notice of
it to the Secretary of your Excellency, sending to him at
the same time justifying pieces and their opinion, to the
end that his Majesty may ordain convenient damages, and
what shall be judged necessary to prevent or remedy like
cases; and it is in this sense that the fortieth and other articles
of the regulation for privateering ought to be understood.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article XI.</span> The sale of prizes and their cargoes,
mentioned by the thirtyseventh, fortyfourth, and other articles
of the royal ordinance for privateering, shall be made,
not only after having prepared an inventory of them, and
in presence of the masters of the interested, or of those
who are legally authorised, but also skilful persons shall
have previously made a formal estimate, in which the causes
of avarice, or others influencing more or less upon the price
of effects, shall be examined and juridically proved, in such
sort, that at all times one may notoriously prove both the
price of merchandises taxed before the sale, and consequently
the frauds which might be committed during the
said sale, as well as the prejudices that might result from
them.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article XII.</span> The intention of his Majesty being,
that this royal declaration be observed, as making part of
his ordinances imprinted and published in all his ports and
maritime places, the King commands me to transmit it to
your Excellency, to have it published to this end, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
you see to its punctual execution, while, on my part, I shall
communicate it to all the Ambassadors and foreign Ministers
residing in this Court, to the end that each one may
give notice of it to his respective nation.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article XIII.</span> In the meantime, his Majesty requires
your Excellency to give also the necessary orders to the
tribunals and counsellors of the Marine, that they may
expedite, with the utmost diligence, the processes begun
relative to stopped vessels conformably to the spirit of this
royal declaration, which as to the essentials agrees with the
precedent ones successively published."</p>

<p>Thus I have gone through these lengthy state papers,
but am under fearful apprehensions that Congress will find
the translation imperfect in some parts, for I have not time
to revise it. I may take this opportunity to observe, that I
have sent many state papers to Congress, which were originally
in English, but which I have first found in the foreign
gazettes and translated from them; which will account
to Congress for the difference, which they will see between
some papers I have sent and the originals.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 8th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There is an article of news from the Hague of the 3d
of May, that they write from Dort, that the recruits of
Anspach and of Hanover, in the pay of England, are embarked
there and sailed from that city the day before yesterday,
in order to go to their destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>There is news also from Stockholm of the 18th of April,
that the ordinance, which the College of the Admiralty has
expedited to all the agents and consuls, who reside in foreign
countries, relating to the convoys necessary to the protection
of the commerce of the subjects of this kingdom,
is as follows, dated Stockholm, April 1st.</p>

<p>"His Majesty having found it necessary to equip a certain
number of vessels of war and frigates, during this year,
to the end to protect the navigation of Swedish merchants,
the College of the Admiralty, in consequence, makes
known, that besides the vessels of war, which are to protect
the vessels of other nations destined for the ports of
this kingdom, to the end, that no hostilities may be committed
upon the coasts of Sweden, the said College has
further judged it necessary, that some frigates ought to
serve as convoys to the Swedish ships, which go to navigate
without the Baltic sea. To this purpose, the Royal College
of the Admiralty has judged proper to give notice, that the
Road of Elsinore will be the rendezvous of all the vessels,
which would take advantage of the convoys, and which
will sail at four different times, to wit;</p>

<p>"The first convoy will sail the 29th of May, with the
merchant vessels, which may be ready, under the escort of
the frigate the Zwarte Orn, commanded by the Major Harald
Christiernin, who has orders to conduct them by the
Canal, [?] as far as Cape Finisterre, and take all possible
care that the vessels arrive in safety in the ports of their
destinations, and afterwards to conduct under his convoy,
destined for the Mediterranean, with the same vigilance,
through the Strait of Gibraltar, as far as the latitude of
Malaga. The second convoy will sail the 14th of July,
with the frigate Höken, under the command of the Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and Chevalier Samuel Orrskiold, who is to convoy with
the same care the merchant ships as far as Cape Finisterre.</p>

<p>"The third will put to sea the 31st of August under the
protection of the frigate Upland, commanded by the Major
and Baron Solomon Christian Von Kokler. Finally,
the fourth convoy will sail on the 30th of September, escorted
by the frigates Sodermanland and the Jaramas,
commanded by the Majors and Chevaliers C. M. Wagenfelt
and Herns Frederic Watchmeister, who are to convoy
with the same care the merchant ships as far as Cape Finisterre,
and afterwards those which are destined for Portugal,
Spain, and the Mediterranean, as well as along the
coast of Europe, as far as Leghorn; the commandant
being to consult with the consuls of their nation where they
cruise during the winter months, to the end to protect the
ships of Swedish subjects, which trade in the Mediterranean;
after which, the said frigates are to repair towards
the middle of February to Malaga, and make in the latitude
of that port their cruises until the end of that month,
to return after that, taking under their convoy the vessels
from thence, and those coming from the Mediterranean,
to reconduct them through the channel into their country.</p>

<p>"It ought not, however, to be forgotten, that no merchant
ships will be taken under convoy, but those only
which shall conform themselves to the ordinance Royal of
the 18th of February, 1779, as well as to the neutrality,
which his Majesty would maintain with the strictest exactness.
Thus the masters of Swedish ships are advertised
by these presents, and it is even enjoined upon
them not to carry any succors into the places or ports,
which may be blocked by one or another of the powers
now at war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>"Nevertheless, notwithstanding this arrangement, his
Majesty will permit, to the end that commerce may
have its course and not be retarded, that liberty be given
to merchant ships to sail without the said convoys, according
to the circumstances in which they may find themselves,
as well as the facility to separate themselves at sea
from the King's ships, if their advantage requires it, in
which case the masters of ships shall be obliged to give
notice of it beforehand to the commanders of frigates. In
one word, the masters of ships shall be held to conform
themselves to the orders, which the chiefs of the convoy
shall give them, and, consequently, to the instructions
which shall be delivered them."</p>

<p>Copies are circulated in London, of the answer which
the Court has made to the declaration of the Empress of
Russia, presented the first of April to the Ministry by M.
de Simolin, Minister Plenipotentiary. This piece, which
was despatched the 13th of April to the Chevalier Harris,
Envoy Extraordinary of his Britannic Majesty to the
Court of Petersburg, is of the following tenor.</p>

<p>"During the whole course of the war, in which the King
of Great Britain finds himself engaged by the aggression of
France and Spain, he has manifested those sentiments of
justice, of equity, and moderation, which govern all his
proceedings. His Majesty has regulated his conduct
towards friendly and neutral powers according to theirs
towards him, conforming it to principles the most clear,
and the most generally acknowledged of the law of nations,
which is the only law between nations who have no
treaties, and to the tenor of his different engagements with
other powers; which engagements have varied this primitive
law by mutual stipulations, and have varied it in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
great variety of different manners, according to the will
and the convenience of the contracting parties. Strongly
attached to her Majesty, the Empress of all the Russias,
by the ties of a reciprocal friendship and a common interest,
the King, from the commencement of the troubles,
gave the most determinate orders to respect the flag of her
Imperial Majesty and the commerce of her subjects, according
to the law of nations and the tenor which he has
contracted in this treaty of commerce with her, and which
he will fulfil with the most scrupulous exactness. The
orders on this subject have been renewed, and the execution
of them shall be strictly attended to. It is to be presumed,
that they will prevent all irregularity; but if it
should happen, that there should be the smallest violation
of these repeated orders, the tribunals of the Admiralty,
which in this country, as in all others, are established to
take cognizance of such matters, and which in all cases
judge solely by the general law of nations, and by the particular
stipulations of different treaties, would redress the
injury in a manner so equitable, that her Imperial Majesty
would be satisfied entirely with their decisions, and would
acknowledge in them the same spirit of justice which animates
herself."</p>

<p>This is said to be the answer to the Empress, and to
be sure it is complaisant enough; but still there is a great
question between the King and the Empress to be decided.
The King says, that all the ports of France and
Spain are blocked by his fleet. The Empress says, that
none of them are or will be, but such before which the
King may send a number of ships to guard the entrance
into them, and make it manifestly dangerous. She adds,
that she has armed and will arm to maintain this construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of the word, and invites all the other maritime powers
to make a league with her in support of this interpretation;
and Holland has already answered that she agrees to it
with gratitude, and all the other powers will answer the
same. If the King gives up his interpretation of the word,
there is an end forever to the naval superiority of Great
Britain. If he maintains it, it must be by a war against all
the nations that use the seas.</p>

<p>But the government and nation are not yet forsaken by
their infatuation. They do not see in the declaration of
the Empress, that she has taken a decided part against
them. But all the rest of the world sees, that a declaration
of war against them would not have been a more decisive
indication of the Empress' judgment or affections.</p>

</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> There is an article in the Amsterdam Gazette
of the 2d of May, taken from the Hague of the 30th of
April, that "Mr Faucet, General in the service of the King
of England, has set off from his residence, and we learn
from Dort, that the English vessels are at last arrived
there, and that the recruits of Anspach and Hanau will be
embarked in a little time to go to America."</p>

<p>This Mr Faucet is the officer (they call him General in
the papers, but I believe he is not more than a Major or
Lieutenant Colonel) whose whole time and service are
devoted to picking up the recruits for the German regiments
in the British service. He constantly fills all the
newspapers of Europe with his motions from place to
place, and gives his accounts an air of mystery, which
leaves the world, both in Europe and America, to magnify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the numbers he raises at discretion, or rather according
to their imaginations. But Congress may rely upon
this, that the service is very unpopular and odious in Germany;
that they are put to great trouble and expense,
annually, to raise the recruits whom they have sent, who
have never been enough to repair the breaches, and that
this year they have not been able to get more than last,
and these will arrive as late as those last year, and in
all probability as sickly.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 8th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The English have a faculty of deceiving themselves,
which has lost them thirteen colonies, has brought them
into a war, first with France and then with Spain, has
nearly lost them Ireland, and has at last put them in a fair
way of uniting all the other maritime powers of Europe
against them. Yet they are still able to deceive themselves.</p>

<p>There is an example of this in the Hague Gazette of the
1st of May, in the article Great Britain.</p>

<p>"They make here a thousand conjectures concerning
the declaration of this Court of the 17th of this month, and
the consequences which may result from it. The declaration
of Russia does not afford less matter of speculation.
It is agreed that it will render the three belligerent powers
very circumspect in their conduct relative to the commerce
of neutral powers, but the more moderate politicians
cannot persuade themselves, that this declaration is more
hostile towards England than towards the other powers at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
war, although our patriots, as they call themselves, exert
themselves to give it a turn, as if Russia had it in view to
break with England.</p>

<p>"Since the unfortunate contest between Great Britain
and her colonies of America, the balance of commerce between
Russia and England has been, one year with another,
more than five hundred thousand pounds in favor of
Russia, and there is also a very considerable balance in
favor of the other northern powers. But these moderate
English politicians ought to consider, whether this balance
of commerce is enough to prevent a great and able princess
from seizing an opportunity of distinguishing her character
with the world and in history, for wisdom, equity, and
magnanimity, by rendering to mankind a most essential
service, by introducing into the law and practice of nations
a reformation of those errors, which the English chiefly had
attempted to establish; a reformation which the interest
and rights of humanity so loudly and manifestly call for,
and by assisting in the separation of the new world from
the domination and monopoly of England, which is also so
obviously for the honor, the prosperity, and the happiness
of mankind in general. The English should further consider,
whether this balance of trade is likely to be less in
favor of Russia, for the independence of America, and for
the security which is aimed at for neutral powers. All the
world out of England sees that it will not."</p>

<p>I will conclude this letter, by adding the letter of Lord
Stormont, of the 17th of April, to the Count de Welderen,
Envoy Extraordinary of their High Mightinesses.</p>

<p>"The King has always hoped, that the faith of treaties
and the ties of an alliance, which has subsisted for more
than a century, as well as those of a reciprocal friendship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and a common interest joined to the evidence of the danger,
which threatens the Republic herself, if France and
Spain accomplish their ambitious designs, would have induced
their High Mightinesses to assist his Majesty to
frustrate these designs by furnishing him the succors stipulated
by treaties the most solemn.</p>

<p>"But since their High Mightinesses have adopted another
system, as contrary to the interests of the Republic as
to those of Great Britain, since they have not made any
answer to the repeated demand of these succors, and have
not even shown the least intention to fulfil engagements so
clear and so formal, his Majesty has found himself necessitated
to execute his intentions, which have been so clearly
announced in the Memorial, which his ambassador presented
the 21st of March last, and in the verbal declaration,
which I had the honor to make to you, by express order
of the King. As you are perfectly informed, Sir, of the
sentiments of his Majesty, it only remains for me to communicate
to you, ministerially, the order which the King
has given in his Council, and to pray you to inform their
High Mightinesses of it. In reading this order, you will
there see, Sir, a particular attention to the interests of the
commercial subjects of their High Mightinesses. The publication
of the memorial presented by the Ambassador of
the King, as well as that of the verbal declaration, will,
without doubt, render all further advertisements unnecessary.
But the King desires, that individuals should suffer
as little as possible from the consequences of a system,
which their High Mightinesses have adopted, and which
appears as opposite to the sentiments of the Dutch nation
as it is to the interests of the Republic."</p>

<p>How confident these people are, that no other nation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Europe understands its own interest. According to them,
France, Spain, Holland, Russia, and the other maritime
powers and the United States of America, are all acting,
shedding their blood, and spending their money for objects
directly opposite to their proper interests. But it is much
to be wished that the English, for the sake of their own
preservation, as well as the report of mankind, could be
brought to think, that other nations understand their own
interests very well.</p>

<h3>TO AN UNKNOWN PERSON.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 9th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I thank you for your note of yesterday, and the papers
enclosed.</p>

<p>The proposals for a general pacification, by the Dean of
Gloucester, whether they were written by him, or by
another, were probably intended to feel the pulse of
France, or Spain, or America. Nay, it is not impossible,
that they might be intended to sound even so inconsiderable
a portion of existence as Mr John Adams. But it
must be something rather more plausibly written; something
a little more consonant to reason, and to common
sense, which will draw out of Mr Adams his sentiments on
the great work of pacification, if ever he should enter into
any detail upon this subject, before general conferences
take place, which he at present believes he shall not do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>Concealing, however, my name, you may take these
few observations upon these proposals.</p>

<p>1. England may be heartily sick of the imprudent part
she has taken. This point I shall not dispute with the
Dean of Gloucester. Yet I wish she would give some better
proof of it, than she has done hitherto. But of Americans
I can speak with confidence and certainty; and so
far from being sick of the part they have taken, they look
upon the past madness of Great Britain, which has compelled
them to overcome all the prejudices and weak passions,
which heretofore bound them to her, and to become
independent, as the greatest blessing which Providence
ever bestowed upon them, from the first plantation in the
new world. They look upon it, that a council of the
wisest statesmen and legislators, consulting together on the
best means of rendering America happy, free, and great,
could not have discovered and digested a system so perfectly
adapted to that end, as this one, which the folly and
wickedness of Great Britain has contrived for them. They
not only see, and feel, and rejoice in the amelioration of
their forms of government, but in the improvement of their
agriculture and their manufactures, and in the discovery,
that all the omnipotence of British fleets has not been able
to prevent their commerce, which is opening and extending
every year, as their population is increasing in the
midst of the war.</p>

<p>2. To suppose that France is sick of the part she has
taken, is to suppose her to be sick of that conduct, which
has procured her more respect and consideration in Europe,
than any step she ever took. It is to suppose her
sick of that system, which enabled her to negotiate the
peace between Russia and the Ottoman Porte, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the peace of Teschen; that system, which has enabled
her to unite, in sentiment and affection, all the maritime
powers, even the United Provinces, in her favor, and
against England. It is to suppose her sick of that system,
which has broken off from her rival and natural enemy the
most solid part of his strength, a strength that had become
so terrible to France, and would have been so fatal to her.
I do not mean to enlarge.</p>

<p>As to the propositions themselves, it would be wasting
time to consider them. Of all the malicious plans of the
English against America, none has ever been more so
than this. It is calculated only to make America the sport
of Britain in future; to put it in her power to be forever
fomenting quarrels and wars; and, I am well persuaded,
that America would sooner vote for a hundred years'
war.</p>

<p>I may be thought again too sanguine. I have been too
sanguine these twenty years, constantly too sanguine; yet
eternally right.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 9th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose to Congress proposals for a
general pacification, by the Dean of Gloucester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>"Proposals to the English, Americans, French, and
Spaniards, now at war.</p>

<p>"First. That Great Britain shall retain Newfoundland,
with the desert coasts of Labradore; also Canada, Nova
Scotia, and the country bordering on the Bay of Fundy,
as far as the bay and river of Penobscot.</p>

<p>"Secondly. That all the country from the Penobscot
river to the river Connecticut, containing almost all the four
populous Provinces of New England, shall be ceded to
the Americans.</p>

<p>"Thirdly. That all the country from the Connecticut
to the river Delaware, containing the whole of New York,
Long Island, and the Jerseys, with some parts of two
other Provinces indenting with them, shall return to Great
Britain.</p>

<p>"Fourthly. That all the country from the Delaware to
the northern boundary of South Carolina, containing the
greatest part of Pennsylvania, all Maryland, Virginia, and
North Carolina, shall be ceded to the Americans.</p>

<p>"Fifthly. That all the country from the northern boundary
of South Carolina to the extreme point of the eastern
Florida, containing three whole Provinces, shall be retained
by Great Britain.</p>

<p>"Sixthly. That West Florida, chiefly barren sand, and
the Fortress of Gibraltar (totally useless,) shall be ceded
to Spain, in order to satisfy the punctilio of that nation,
and that the Spaniards shall give Porto Rico in exchange,
an island on which they seem to set no value and which
indeed is of no use to them, though large in itself, stored
with good ports, well situated, and capable (in the hands of
the English) of great improvements.</p>

<p>"Seventhly. Lastly, that the English shall give up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
conquests they have made on the French in the East
Indies, who shall do the like to the English in the West
Indies."</p>

<p>I shall make no remarks upon this plan, but there is no
Englishman who thinks of a wiser, or at least who dares
propose one. All, who talk of propositions, throw out
something as absurd and idle as this, which will convince
Congress that we shall have no peace for some time.</p>

<p>The French armament, which sailed from Brest the
2d of May, under the command of M. de Rochambeau,
of the troops, and M. de Ternay, of the fleet, and the
armament from Cadiz, of twelve ships of the line, besides
frigates and other armed vessels, with eleven thousand five
hundred land forces, with a fine train of artillery, which
were to sail about the same time, or earlier, both destined
for America, as it is supposed, will I hope bring the English
to think of some plan a little more rational.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 10th, 1780</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 19th of April, Mr Grattan, in the House of Commons
of Ireland, moved a resolution, "That the King's
Most Excellent Majesty, Lords and Commons of Ireland,
are the only powers competent to make laws to bind this
Kingdom." Mr Stewart seconded the motion.</p>

<p>The Attorney General moved an amendment to adjourn
the question until the 1st day of September next.</p>

<p>Mr Burgh moved another amendment, "That there
being an equal resolution on the books (in the journals in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the month of July, 1641) with the one now moved, the
same may be, for that reason, adjourned to the 1st day of
September next."</p>

<p>The House divided at a late hour on the original
amendment, when there appeared, ayes, ninetyseven;
noes, one hundred and thirtysix; majority, thirtynine.</p>

<p>Thus the House of Commons have refused to pursue
the sense of the people, but these are so unanimous and
so determined, that no magistrate will venture to execute
any act of the English Parliament.</p>

<p>Philip and Mary, 4. chap. 4th, thus explains Poyning's
law. "And this act of the 10th of Henry the
Seventh, shall be expounded and taken as followeth, that is
to say, that no Parliament be holden or summoned within
this realm of Ireland, until the Lieutenant, Chief Governor,
or Governors, and the Council of Ireland, shall have
certified the King and Queen's Majesties, her heirs and
successors under the great seal of the realm, the considerations,
causes, and articles of such acts, as by them shall
be thought meet to be enacted and passed here by Parliament,
and shall also have received again their Majesties'
answer under the great seal of England, declaring their
pleasure, either for the passing of the said acts in such
form as they should be sent into England, or else for the
alteration of them, or any part of the same."</p>

<p>"Section 2d. After such return made, and after license
and authority to summon a Parliament within the
said realm of Ireland, granted under the great seal of
England unto the said lieutenant, or chief governors of the
same realm, the same lieutenant, chief governor or governors,
may summon and hold a Parliament for passing
and agreeing upon such acts, and no other, as shall be so
returned under the great seal of England."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>"6 of George 1, chap. 5, sec. 1. The kingdom of
Ireland has been, is, and of right ought to be, subordinate
unto, and dependent upon the Imperial Crown of Great
Britain, as being inseparably united and annexed thereunto;
and the King, with the consent of the Lords and
Commons of Great Britain, in Parliament, hath power to
make laws of sufficient force to bind the kingdom and people
of Ireland."</p>

<p>"Section 2d. The House of Lords of Ireland have
not, nor of right ought to have, any jurisdiction to judge
of, affirm, or reverse any judgment or decree made in any
court within the said kingdom; and all proceedings before
the said House of Lords upon any such judgment or decree
are void."</p>

<p>These are the political shackles, which the people of
Ireland are endeavoring to shake off; and if the war continues
long, they will succeed; otherwise, not entirely,
although the authority of the British Parliament will, undoubtedly,
be much weakened.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 11th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>On Monday, the first of May, Mr David Hartley explained
what was the substance of his intended motion for
Friday, respecting the state of the war. In the course of
his speech, he moved for a copy of the French Memorial,
entitled <em>Observations on the justifying Memorial of Great
Britain</em>, which contains many points of serious information
respecting France, Spain and America. He then
read to the House the three following motions; the first
of which, originating in the county of York, is to be made
jointly by Mr Hartley and his friend Sir George Saville.</p>

<p>"1st. That it is the opinion of this House, that the
prosecution of an offensive war in America is most evidently
a measure, which, by employing our great and enormously
expensive military operations against the inhabitants
of that country, prevents this from exerting its united, vigorous,
and firm efforts against the powers of France and
Spain, and has no other effect upon America, than to continue,
and thereby increase the enmity, which has so long
subsisted between the arms of both, can be productive of
no good whatever, but by preventing conciliation, threatens
the accomplishment of the final ruin of the British Empire.</p>

<p>"2dly. That an address be presented to his Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
stating the matter of the foregoing resolution, and entreating
him to concur therewith; representing, at the same
time, that they think that they should betray his Majesty
and their constituents, if they did not distinctly state to his
Majesty, that nothing less than a total change of councils,
proceeding from the conviction of past errors, can prevent
the consummation of public ruin; but, at the same time, to
express their fullest confidence, that with a speedy and
fundamental reformation of councils, under a prudent and
vigilant administration, they shall be enabled to maintain
the honor and dignity of this country against any confederacy
of France and Spain, and to effect a reconciliation
with America, upon beneficial, just, and honorable terms.</p>

<p>"3dly. That leave be given to bring in a bill, to enable
his Majesty to appoint Commissioners with sufficient power
to treat, consult, and finally agree upon the means of restoring
peace with the Provinces in North America."</p>

<p>After which, General Conway rose to declare, that he
had a bill to propose on the subject of the American war,
which he would lay before the House tomorrow. He
gave a general hint of the ideas he entertained on this subject.
He thought that Parliament ought to come to some
resolutions to agree on certain propositions, which should
be held out to the Americans as the foundation of a treaty
of peace and reconciliation.</p>

<p>I shall give an account of the debates and decisions on
the motions when the papers arrive.</p>

<h3>TO COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 9th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you did me the honor
to write to me, on the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>Although the writer of the letter, an extract of which I
had the honor to enclose to you, may be right in his conjectures,
that the British administration wish to know more
than they do at present of my sentiments upon the great
subject of a pacification, yet I have had too long experience
of their principles, views, and tempers, and I know
that they are too well acquainted with mine, for me to expect,
that they will directly convey any proposition to me.
When we hear them affirm in Parliament, that America is
upon the point of returning to an allegiance to the King of
England, and that they seriously believe, that America will
return to such an allegiance; when the members of the
opposition, even those who are the most inclined to peace,
such as Mr Hartley, General Conway, &amp;c. discover plainly,
by their motions and arguments, that their object is a
separate peace with America, in order to be the better
able to gratify their revenge against France and Spain, I
can have no expectations, that they think of applying to
me, because I think they must be convinced of this, at
least, that I shall make no separate peace. I thank your
Excellency, however, for your sentiments, that I ought to
hear them, in case any overtures should be made to me.
I should, in such a case, endeavor to hear them with decency
and respect; but it would require much philosophy
to hear, with patience, such absurd and extravagant propositions,
as are published in pamphlets and newspapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and made in Parliament, even by the members of the opposition,
who profess to be most zealous for peace.</p>

<p>Our alliance with France is an honor and a security,
which have ever been near to my heart. After reflecting
long upon the geographical situation of the old world and
the new, the agriculture, commerce, and political relations
of both, upon the connexions and oppositions among the
nations of the former, and the mutual wants and interests
of both, according to such imperfect lights as I was able to
obtain, the result has long since been this, that my country,
in case she should be compelled to break off from Great
Britain, would have more just reasons to depend upon a
reciprocity of the good offices of friendship from France,
Spain, and the other sovereigns, who are usually in their
system, than upon those in the opposite scale of the
balance of power. I have ever thought it, therefore, a
natural alliance, and contended for it as a rock of defence.</p>

<p>This object I pursued in Congress, with persevering
assiduity for more than a year, in opposition to other gentlemen
of much greater name and abilities than mine, and
I had at length the satisfaction to find my countrymen very
generally fall in with the same sentiment, and the honor to
be appointed to draw the first treaty, which was sent to this
Court. These facts have been well known in America,
even to the tories, and the utility and importance of this
alliance being known to be deeply imprinted in my mind
and heart, I suppose was a principal cause why the present
trust was confided to me by my countrymen. These
facts, although they may have been unknown in France,
yet having been known to the tories in America, I cannot
suppose they are ignorant of them at the Court of St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
James; I therefore think, that neither the administration
nor opposition in England will ever think of applying to
me, until they are brought into such a situation as shall
compel them to sue for peace with all the powers at war,
which, to be sure, does not appear to be the case at present,
nor likely to be, at least before the end of this campaign;
nor then either, without some notable good fortune
on the part of the allies in the progress of the war.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 13th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I had two days ago the pleasure of yours of the 26th of
April, and am very happy to have at last received from
your hand an account of your safe arrival in Madrid.</p>

<p>The Count de Florida Blanca is allowed to be a man
of abilities, but somehow or other there is something in the
European understanding different from those we have been
used to. Men of the greatest abilities and the most experience
are with great difficulty brought to see what appears
to us as clear as day. It is habit, it is education, prejudice,
what you will, but so it is.</p>

<p>I can state a very short argument, that appears to me a
demonstration upon French and Spanish principles alone,
that it is more for their interest to employ their naval force
in America than in Europe; yet it is in vain, that you
state this to a Minister of State. He cannot see it or
feel it, at least, in its full force, until the proper point of
time is past and it is too late. So I think it may be
demonstrated, that it is the interest of France and Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to furnish America with a handsome loan of money, or
even to grant her subsidies; because a sum of money
thus expended would advance the common cause, and
even their particular interests, by enabling the Americans
to make greater exertions than the same sums employed
in any other way. But it is in vain to reason in this manner
with a European Minister of State. He cannot understand
you. It is not within the compass of those ideas,
which he has been accustomed to.</p>

<p>I am happy, however, that at length we have a Minister
at Madrid; I am persuaded, that this will contribute vastly
to opening the eyes both of France and Spain. I shall be
always obliged to you for intelligence, especially concerning
your progress in your affair.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 13th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The answer of the King of France to the declaration of
the Empress of Russia is as follows, dated April 25th,
1780.</p>

<p>"The war in which the King finds himself engaged,
having no other object than the attachment of his Majesty
to the principles of the liberty of the seas, he could not but
see with a true satisfaction the Empress of Russia adopt
this same principle, and show herself resolved to maintain
it. That which her Imperial Majesty requires of the belligerent
powers, is nothing more than the rules already prescribed
to the French marine, the execution of which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
supported with an exactness that is known and applauded
by all Europe.</p>

<p>"The liberty of neutral vessels, restrained in a small
number of cases only, is a direct consequence of the law
of nature, the safeguard of nations, the solace even of
those, who are afflicted with the scourge of war; thus the
King has desired to procure, not only to the subjects of the
Empress of Russia, but to those of all the States who have
embraced a neutrality, the liberty of navigating upon the
same conditions, which are announced in the declaration
to which his Majesty answers this day.</p>

<p>"He thinks he has made a great step towards the general
good, and prepared an epoch glorious to his reign, in
fixing by his example, the rights, which every belligerent
power may and ought to acknowledge to be acquired to
neutral vessels. His hope has not deceived him, since the
Empress, in determining on the most exact neutrality, has
declared herself for the system which the King supports, at
the expense of the blood of his people, and since she demands
the rights, which his Majesty would make the basis
of the maritime code. If there were occasions for fresh
orders, whereby the vessels of her Imperial Majesty should
have no room to fear being disturbed in their negotiation,
by the subjects of the King, his Majesty would make haste
to give them; but the Empress will, no doubt, repose herself
upon the dispositions of his Majesty, contained in the
regulations, which he has published. They are not accommodated
to present circumstances, they are founded
upon the law of nations, and they are consistent with the
character of a Prince, sufficiently happy to find always in
the general prosperity the measure of that of his own
kingdom. The King wishes that her Imperial Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
would add to the means, which she may take to fix the
nature of merchandises, the commerce of which is reputed
contraband in time of war, precise rules concerning the
form of sea papers, with which the Russian vessels shall
be furnished.</p>

<p>"With this precaution, his Majesty is assured, that no
incident will arise, which will occasion any regret in any of
the parties concerned, at the measures taken for rendering
the condition of Russian vessels as advantageous as possible
in time of war. Happy circumstances have already
more than once put the two Courts in a situation to experience
of how much importance it was, that they should
explain themselves with openness upon their interests respectively.</p>

<p>"His Majesty felicitates himself, upon having an opportunity
to express to her Imperial Majesty his manner of
thinking upon a point interesting to Russia, and the commercial
powers of Europe. His Majesty applauds so
much the more sincerely the principles and views which
direct the Empress, as his Majesty enjoys in common with
her the same sentiment, which has prompted this Princess
to measures, from whence must result equal advantages to
their subjects and to all nations."</p>

<p>No state paper, that I have seen this war, has struck me
more forcibly than this. The simplicity, openness, sincerity,
and truth of it, form a striking contrast to the dissimulation
and insincerity, which are so grossly remarkable
in the answer of the Court of St James to the same declaration.
The one is perfectly becoming the character of
an august King, the other is what I shall leave others to
name.</p>

arrived here, within a little time, several couriers from Petersburg,
some of whom have been sent back, and others
have continued their route for Holland, France, &amp;c.
Since the arrival of the last, it is thought that our Court
has acceded to the project of an armed neutrality, and that
it has already agreed with that of Russia, upon the equipments
to be made for this purpose; at least orders have
been given to arm as soon as possible two ships of the
line, the Princess Sophia Frederica, of seventyfour guns,
and the Danebrog, of sixty. These ships, commanded by
Krieger and Ellebracht, will go out into the Road immediately.
The government have determined not to keep
the fleet stationed at Fredericksham, as it has been for five
years past; and the Vice Admiral Fischer, who commanded
there, having been recalled, will be relieved only by a
Captain."</p>

<p>The following orders have been given by the King of
England.</p>

<p>"Whereas, after our Order in Council of the 17th of
April, 1780, the several treaties, which granted particular
privileges to the subjects of the States-General of the
United Provinces, relative to their commerce and navigation
in time of war, are suspended, and the subjects of the
States-General ought to be considered upon the same
footing with other neutral States not privileged by treaties,
until it shall please us formally to signify the contrary;
the commanders of our vessels of war, and those of all
ships and vessels of war, which have letters of marque and
reprisals, are authorised by these presents and required to
seize and detain all ships and vessels, belonging to the subjects
of the States-General, when they shall be found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>

has carried into Margate, the Grede Vizwagten, going

<h3>TO JOHN JAY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 15th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I shall not always stand upon ceremonies, nor wait for
answers to letters, because useful hints may be given,
which would be lost if one were to wait returns of posts.</p>

<p>The British Channel fleet is reckoned this year at from
thirtyfour to thirtyseven ships of the line; but it is well
known, that they depend upon seamen to be pressed from
their first West India fleet, in order to make up this computation,
without which they cannot make thirty. It is,
therefore, of great importance that this first West India
fleet should be intercepted. It will come home the latter
end of June, or the beginning of July; certainly not before
the middle of June. A ship or two of the line, with a
fifty gun ship or two and five or six frigates, would have a
great probability of intercepting this fleet. Is there any
service upon which such a number of vessels could be
better employed, than in cruising pretty far in the Bay of
Biscay, and somewhat north of Cape Clear with this view?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
It is really astonishing that France and Spain should be so
inattentive to the English convoys. The safest, easiest,
and surest way of reducing the power and the spirits of the
English is to intercept their trade. It is every year exposed,
yet every year escapes; by which means they get
spirits to indulge their passions, money to raise millions,
and men to man their ships.</p>

<p>Pray is it not necessary to think a little of Portugal?
Should not Spain, France, and America too, use their influence
with Portugal, to shut her ports against the armed
vessels of all nations at war, or else admit freely the armed
vessels of all? Under her present system of neutrality, as
they call it, the ports of Portugal are as advantageous to
England as any of her own, and more injurious to the trade
of Spain and America if not of France, while they are of
no use at all to France, Spain, or America. This little
impotent morsel of a State ought not to do so much mischief
so unjustly. If she is neutral, let her be neutral;
not say she is neutral, and be otherwise.</p>

<p>Would it not be proper for Congress to discover some sensibility
to the injuries, which the United States receive from
these States, such as Denmark and Portugal? I think
they should remonstrate coolly and with dignity; not go to
war, nor be in a passion about it; but show that they understand
their behavior. Denmark restored Jones' and
Landais' prizes to England, without knowing why. Why
would it not do to remonstrate; then prohibit any of the
productions of Portugal from being consumed in America?</p>

<p>The prospect brightens in the West Indies. De Guichen
has arrived. De la Motte Piquet has defended himself
very well, secured his convoys, fought the English,
even with inferior force, and got the better. De Guichen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
appearance dissipated all thoughts of their expedition, and
threw the English Islands into great consternation; but
you will see in the public prints all the news.</p>

<p>The force from Brest, which sailed on the 2d, and that
from Cadiz, which I hope sailed as soon or sooner, will
not diminish the terror and confusion of the English in
America and the islands.</p>

yet made any maritime treaty with the States of Barbary,
and as its commerce in the Mediterranean may be exposed

<h3>TO M. GENET, AT VERSAILLES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 17th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>General Conway, in his speech in the House of Commons,
on the 6th of May, affirms, that the alliance between
France and the United States is not natural. Whether it
is or not, is no doubt a great question. In order to determine
whether it is or not, one should consider what is
meant by a natural alliance; and I know of no better rule
than this; when two nations have the same interests in
general, they are natural allies; when they have opposite
interests, they are natural enemies. The General observes,
first, that nature has raised a barrier between France and
America; but nature has raised no other barrier than the
ocean; and the distance and this barrier are equally great
between England and America. The General will not
pretend that nature, in the constitution of American minds
or bodies, has laid any foundation for friendship or enmity
towards one nation more than another. The General observes,
further, that habit has raised another barrier between
France and America. But he should have considered,
that the habits of affection or enmity between
nations are easily changed, as circumstances vary, and as
essential interests alter. Besides, the fact is, that the horrible
perfidy and cruelty of the English towards the Americans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
which they have taken care to make universally felt
in that country for a long course of years past, have alienated
the American mind and heart from the English; and
it is now much to be doubted, whether any nation of Europe
is so universally and heartily detested by them. On
the contrary, most of the other nations of Europe have
treated them with civility, and France and Spain with
esteem, confidence, and affection, which has greatly
changed the habits of the Americans in this respect.</p>

<p>The third material, of which the general barrier is created,
is language. This, no doubt, occasions many difficulties
in the communication between the allies; but it is
lessening every day. Perhaps no language was ever
studied at once by so many persons at a time, in proportion,
as the French is now studied in America. And it is
certain, that English was never so much studied in France
as since the revolution; so that the difficulties of understanding
one another are lessening every day.</p>

<p>Religion is the fourth part of the barrier. But let it be
considered, first, that there is not enough of religion of any
kind among the great in England to make the Americans
very fond of them. Secondly, that what religion there is in
England, is as far from being the religion of America as
that of France. The hierarchy of England is quite as
disagreeable to America as that of any other country.
Besides, the Americans know very well, that the spirit of
propagating any religion by conquest, and of making proselytes
by force or by intrigue, is fled from all other countries
of the world, in a great measure, and that there is more of
this spirit remaining in England than anywhere else. And
the Americans had, and have still, more reason to fear the
introduction of a religion that is disagreeable to them, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
least as far as bishops and hierarchy go, from a connexion
with England, than with any other nation of Europe.</p>

<p>The alliance with France has no article respecting religion.
France neither claims nor desires any authority or
influence over America in this respect; whereas, England
claimed and intended to exercise authority and force over
the Americans; at least, so far as to introduce bishops;
and the English Society for Propagating Religion in Foreign
Parts, has, in fact, for a century, sent large sums of
money to America to support their religion there, which
really operated as a bribe upon many minds, and was the
principal source of toryism. So that upon the whole, the
alliance with France is in fact more natural, as far as religion
is concerned, than the former connexion with Great
Britain, or any other connexion that can be formed.</p>

<p>Indeed, whoever considers attentively this subject, will
see, that these three circumstances of habit, language, and
religion, will for the future operate as natural causes of
animosity between England and America, because they
will facilitate migration. The loss of liberty, the decay of
religion, the horrible national debt, the decline of commerce,
and of political importance in Europe, and of maritime
power, which cannot but take place in England, will
tempt numbers of their best people to emigrate to America;
and to this, fashion, language, and religion will contribute.
The British government will, therefore, see themselves
obliged to restrain this by many ways; and among others,
by cultivating an animosity and hatred in the minds of
their people against the Americans. Nature has already
sufficiently discovered itself, and all the world sees, that
the British government have for many years, not only indulged
in themselves the most unsocial and bitter passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
against Americans, but have systematically encouraged
them in the people.</p>

<p>After all, the circumstances of modes, language, and
religion, have much less influence in determining the
friendship and enmity of nations, than other more essential
interests. Commerce is more than all these and many
more such circumstances. Now it is easy to see, that the
commercial interests of England and America will forever
hereafter be incompatible. America will take away, or at
least diminish, the trade of the English in ship building, in
freight, in the whale fisheries, in the cod fisheries, in furs
and skins, and in other particulars, too many to enumerate.
In this respect, America will not interfere with France,
but on the contrary, will facilitate and benefit the French
commerce and marine, to a very great degree. Here,
then, will be a perpetual rivalry and competition between
England and America, and a continual source of animosity
and war. America will have occasion for the alliance of
France, to defend her against this ill will of England, as
France will stand in need of that of America, to aid her
against the natural and continual jealousies and hostility of
England.</p>

<p>The boundaries of territory will also be another constant
source of disputes. If a peace should unhappily be
made, leaving England in possession of Canada, Nova
Scotia, the Floridas, or any one spot of ground in America,
they will be perpetually encroaching upon the States of
America; whereas, France, having renounced all territorial
jurisdiction in America, will have no room for controversy.</p>

<p>The people of America, therefore, whose very farmers
appear to have considered the interests of nations more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
profoundly than General Conway, are universally of the
opinion, that from the time they declared themselves
independent, England became their natural enemy and
as she has been for centuries, and will be the natural
enemy of France, and the natural ally of other natural
enemies of France, America became the natural friend of
France, and she the natural friend of the United States;
Powers naturally united against a common enemy, whose
interests will long continue to be reciprocally secured and
promoted by mutual friendship.</p>

<p>It is very strange, that the English should thus dogmatically
judge of the interests of all other nations. According
to them, the Americans are, and have been for many
years, acting directly against their own interest; France
and Spain have been acting against their own interests;
Holland is acting against her own interest; Russia and the
Northern Powers are all acting against their own interests;
Ireland is acting against hers, &amp;c.; so that there is only
that little island of the whole world, that understands their
own interest; and of the inhabitants of that, the committees,
and associations, and assemblies, are all in the same
error with the rest of the world; so that there remains
only the Ministry and their equivocal and undulating majority,
among all the people upon the face of the earth, who
act naturally, and according to their own interests. The
rest of the world, however, think that they understand
themselves very well, and that it is the English or Scottish
majority who are mistaken.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 19th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose a few newspapers, received
by the last post from Boston, by the way of Bilboa.
There is very little news. I have letters as late as the
27th of March.</p>

<p>The most remarkable thing in the Pennsylvania Gazette
is, that the great seal of the Province of Pennsylvania was
brought into the House of the Assembly of that State, and
by order of the House defaced and cut to pieces, which,
to be sure, is no proof of a desire to go back to their
old government. I do not see how they could have expressed
a stronger contempt of it.</p>

<p>In the Independent Chronicle of the 9th of March is a
list of prizes, made by the privateers of the middle district
of the Massachusetts Bay, only since the last session of the
Court of Admiralty. They amount to nineteen vessels;
which shows that privateering flourishes in those seas, and
also shows what havoc may, and probably will be made
among the English transports, provision vessels, and merchant-men,
when the superiority of the French and Spanish
fleets comes to be as clear, as it soon will be; perhaps,
as it is now, and has been, since the arrival of M. de
Guichen.</p>

<p>In a private letter of the 27th of March I am told, that
two prizes had just then arrived, one with four hundred
hogsheads of rum, and another with four thousand barrels
of flour, pork, and beef, articles much wanted by the
enemy, and not at all amiss in Boston.</p>

<p>The convention had gone through the constitution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 19th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The answer of the King of Spain to the declaration of
the Empress of Russia, is said to be in substance,</p>

<p>"That the King has received with pleasure the overtures,
which have been made to him on the part of her Majesty,
the Empress of Russia, relative to the measures which this
Princess proposes to follow, both with regard to the Courts
actually at war and the neutral powers; that these principles
are precisely the same which have governed the King
heretofore, and which he has endeavored to recommend
to Great Britain; that from the beginning of the troubles,
his Catholic Majesty has not departed from the system of
equity and of moderation, of which he has given proofs to
all the powers of Europe, and that he is solely upon the
arbitrary proceedings of England, that he determined
upon more vigorous measures; that since the English, far
from respecting the neutral flags, have even allowed themselves
to attack vessels, the cargoes of which are authorised
by treaties, it became necessary, that Spain on her
part should take care of her interests; that the King, not
content to confine himself to the frequent marks which he
has given of his equity, declares, moreover, that he is
ready to show all possible deference for those of the neutral
powers, who shall determine to protect their flags, and
that he will continue faithful to his engagement, until England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
shall put an end to those exactions, which her ships
do not cease to commit; that in fine, his Catholic Majesty
accedes to the other articles of the declaration presented
the 15th of April, by the Sieur de Sinovief, but flatters
himself at the same time, that for what concerns the
blockade of Gibraltar, her Imperial Majesty will prescribe
to her subjects to conform themselves to the restrictions
proposed by the ordinance issued at Madrid the 13th of
March last."</p>

<p>It is said, that in conformity to the resolutions taken by
their High Mightinesses the 25th of last month, the Count
de Welderen has presented a Memorial to Lord Stormont,
who after having run it over answered, "that he would
lay it before his Majesty, and request his orders upon the
subject; although beforehand he could assure him, that
the King highly approved the conduct held by Mr Fielding,
as well as the manner in which he had executed his
orders," adding, "that at London we think that Mr Fielding
conducted himself according to the tenor of treaties,
and that it was the Count de Byland that violated them."</p>

<p>This answer having given rise to an animated conversation
between the Count de Welderen and Lord Stormont,
the latter employed all possible arguments to prove, that it
was the Count de Byland who had been the aggressor,
while, on the contrary, the Minister of their High Mightinesses
had asserted, and incontestably proved, "that their
High Mightinesses had never consented, that any ship found
under the convoy of one of their vessels of war should be
visited; and that, consequently, Commodore Fielding, who
ought not to have been ignorant of the treaties, and who,
nevertheless, had so manifestly infringed them, had been
truly the aggressor, in sending out his armed boat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>That as to the last point of the said Memorial, relative
to the liberation, without any form of process, of the vessels
seized sailing under convoy of the Count de Byland, Lord
Stormont answered, "the way of appeal lay open to the
parties interested, but that it was not in the power of his
Majesty to transgress the ordinary forms, by making any
alteration in the decrees pronounced upon this occasion."</p>

<p>Ireland, although her Parliament has discovered symptoms
of timidity or diffidence in postponing the great question
to September, has not yet finished her roll upon the
stage. It should be remembered, first, that she has postponed,
not determined, the controversy. Secondly, that
all parties in the House united in declaring their sentiments,
that Ireland was not subject to any foreign legislation.
In this, even Mr Foster, who is reputed the Ministerial
agent in the House of Commons, and the Attorney
General himself, concurred. Thirdly, that it is still in
contemplation to pass a mutiny act through the Irish Parliament,
which must be grounded upon the supposition,
that the English mutiny act is not binding; and whether
such a bill shall pass or not, many magistrates will not execute
the English act. Fourthly, the volunteers of the liberty
of Dublin have resolved unanimously, on the 26th of
April, that it is inexpedient to remain any longer under
the command of his Grace the Duke of Leinster. Fifthly,
the body of lawyers, on the 30th of April, admitted Mr
Grattan as an honorary member of their society, and
unanimously voted an address to him, which, with his answer,
Congress will see.</p>

<p>I am very sorry it is not in my power to enclose to
Congress the English papers later than the 5th, because
they contain intelligence of importance, which is favorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 20th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>In the House of Commons on the 6th of May, General
Conway read the title, and explained the clauses, of his
proposed bill for reconciliation or peace with America. It
consisted in the repeal of all the acts, which have revolted
America. He desired, that the House would receive it,
add to it, subtract from it, modify and alter it, as they
pleased.</p>

<p>Lord Nugent agreed to the necessity of doing something,
which should give Great Britain a hope of reconciliation
with America; he did not approve the tenor of the
bill, although he seconded the motion, but invited the
House to prepare one.</p>

<p>"It is certain," said Lord Nugent, "that in the alarming
situation we are in, it is of decisive importance to make
peace with America, for in fact we having nothing but her,
there does not remain to us one power in Europe, and
what is worse, an armed neutrality against the spirit of
treaties, speaking the language of neutral powers, seconds
efficaciously the powers who are our enemies. It is about
twenty years, that the state of affairs is considerably
changed in Europe; it is the King of Prussia, who has
effected this revolution. Considering the turn, which affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
have taken under his reign, Prussia gives actually as much
umbrage to the House of Austria, as the House of Bourbon
gave it heretofore; so that on one hand the difference
of interests, on the other the influence of certain Courts,
and in several other Cabinets a profound indifference, have
totally turned what is called the balance of power; nevertheless,
if those of the Princes of Europe, who ought to
sustain us, contemplate coldly our fall, they have not only
renounced the principles of honor, but they have even lost
out of sight their proper interests; for if they suffer the
House of Bourbon to become the first maritime power of
Europe, their States must in their turn partake of our fall;
but they occupy themselves with momentary interests, and
sacrifice to transient considerations those solid and permanent
interests, which wise men never lose sight of."</p>

<p>By comparing this speech with the declaration of Lord
Nugent's repentance for having called us rebels, and the
Ode to Mankind, and altogether with the true state of facts
and political interests of the world at present, we shall see,
that his Lordship is more of a poet and an honest man,
than he is of a great statesman; for in the first place the
armed neutrality is not against the spirit of treaties. In
the next place, it is not in fact the King of Prussia, but
the United States of America, who have effected the revolution
in the political system and the variation in the balance
of power. Thirdly, it is not because certain powers
contemplate coldly the fall of England, but because they
see England is unable to stand in the rank she once held,
and that there is a new power arising in the West, in which
they are all interested, who will not only maintain her
ground, but advance with a rapidity, that has no example,
and that it is the interest of all the powers, that no one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
them should have an exclusive monopoly of the commerce
or political weight of this rising State, that stimulates them
to favor it.</p>

<p>But it is really surprising to observe how few persons
there are in England, who have reflected upon the present
state of the world, and have had sagacity enough to penetrate
the true principles of its policy.</p>

<p>Mr Eden followed Lord Nugent in the debate, and indulged
himself in sporting with the flowers of rhetoric,
and pleasantries of wit, without many solid observations
that deserve notice. It may not be improper to remark
two or three things however. "In general," says he, "the
object of the honorable member, General Conway, is extremely
praiseworthy; but the present moment is not
proper for the pursuit of it; it is not at present, that Parliament
can say, we will grant this, or will refuse that, because
they ask nothing of us. Every unsolicited offer will
be regarded as a tacit confession of our weakness; a
useless instrument in the hands of the well intentioned inhabitants,
it will become an offensive and dangerous arm in
the hands of Congress. It is important for the present, to
leave the scales in the equilibrium where they are. The
return of the Americans to the suggestions of duty and
loyalty now divides the Continent, by diminishing the
number of the supporters of rebellion, now shaken to its
centre. In such circumstances a manly confidence, wisdom,
and moderation may make the balance incline to our
side. Precipitation in our councils, superfluous discussions,
domestic divisions, premature and imprudent overtures,
may draw it over to the other forever. I say superfluous
discussions, this is the most dangerous of all those
that I comprehend in the number, and consequently to put
an end to it, I demand the order of the day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>Lord George Gordon seconded the motion of Mr Eden,
not because he was of his opinion, for he ridiculed it with
all the wit imaginable, but because the General's bill appeared
to him to announce a commission as ridiculous as
that of 1780,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> since probably they would not begin by
acknowledging the independence of America. Mr Cruger
said, that if peace with America could not be obtained
without acknowledging her independence, they ought not
to hesitate a moment. Mr W. Pitt said, that neither conciliatory
bills, nor peace making commissioners, would make
peace with America. The Ministry must retire. The
Americans will never listen to any propositions until the
present Ministers resign their places to men, who have not
lost the confidence of America by deceiving them, and the
confidence of the nation by imposing upon Parliament.</p>

<p>Here is another proof among many, that are given every
day by the opposition themselves, of their hunger for the
loaves and fishes, and that they do not mean with good
faith to make peace, America would as readily make
peace upon proper terms with the present Ministry as any
other, and she would not make peace upon improper terms&mdash;with
any other Ministry sooner than with the present.</p>

<p>Lord George Germain said, "If our reconciliation with
America depended upon the resignation of the present
Ministers, and they were convinced of the efficacy of this
measure, I am persuaded they would take it unanimously
forthwith. Most certainly all good men in the kingdom
ought to wish, that peace may be made upon honorable
and advantageous terms. This is the wish of my heart,
and I flatter myself, that its accomplishment is not far off.
This is not speculation, my opinion is founded upon fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
advices. I firmly believe, that the moment of reconciliation
is not far distant. The state of profound distress, to
which the Americans find themselves reduced, has brought
them back, if not to duty in general, at least to reflection,
and to a knowledge of their true interests; and I can assure
the House, that the greatest number not only desire to
return to their allegiance, but express the desire of it, and
testify that they are ready to seize a favorable opportunity,
and would not wait for any opportunity, if they were not
held in by the tyranny of those, who have made themselves
masters of power. I do not think, that the Congress
will ever appear disposed to enter into treaty, but the misery
of the people, but the depreciation of the paper money,
but the burden of debt, under which the community staggers,
but the repugnance, which all orders of the people
testify for the alliance, which they have made them contract
with France, the little utility, which this alliance has
been of to America, all announce in time, that the different
assemblies of that Continent will not be long before they
come to terms."</p>

<p>It is really difficult to say what epithets ought to be
given to this speech. When a Minister of a great nation
can rise in its great Council, and with so much cold blood,
so much solemnity, and such appearance of reflection and
deliberation affirm such things, what shall we say?</p>

<p>The absurdity of his distinctions is not less remarkable,
than the grossness of his misinformation respecting facts,
that Congress will not treat, but the several Assemblies will.
Is not Congress the creature of the Assemblies? Do not
the Assemblies create the members of Congress every
year? Cannot they annihilate them every moment? Cannot
the Assemblies instruct their members of Congress?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Cannot the people instruct their members of Assembly?
But it is endless to remark. The same system of fraud
and misrepresentation, which first deceived Great Britain
into this controversy and war with America, still deceives
them into the continuance of it, and will deceive them to
their ruin. This should be the less afflicting to America,
as, since there is every reason to think, that Great Britain
will be hereafter our natural and habitual enemy, disposed
to war with us whenever she can, the more completely she
is exhausted, humbled, and abased before the peace, the
securer we shall be forever after.</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> The Chargé des Affaires of Denmark has notified
to the Ministry at Stockholm, the 28th of April, that
this Court had acceded to the armed neutrality, to which
the Empress of Russia had invited it, and he has requested,
in consequence, in the name of his sovereign, his Swedish
Majesty, to enter into the same confederation. Although no
positive answer has as yet been given him, it is nevertheless
not at all doubted, that Sweden will concur with the other
neutral maritime powers, to restrain the excesses of the armed
ships and cruisers of the belligerent powers; an excess
of which the rencounter of the frigate Illerim, with a cruiser
from Mahon, furnished a new example, as was remarked
at the head of the relation, which the Court has published
of it.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 20th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>As my English papers, containing the debates on the 6th
of this month on General Conway's motion, are lost in the
sea, I shall give Congress the several accounts of them
from the foreign gazettes. That of the Hague gives the
following account of the General's discourse.</p>

<p>"Two powerful motives have induced me to undertake
the formation of this bill; the indispensable necessity in
which we find ourselves to make peace with America, and
the favorable disposition in which I suppose America to be.</p>

<p>"To show the nature of the horrible war, which I propose
to put an end to, it is necessary to go back to its origin.
I find it in that committee of darkness, which met in
this house fifteen years ago at midnight. This company
of black conspirators, who plotted in their conventicle the
destruction of the British empire, and sowed the seed of
all the evils, of all the disgraces, and of all the insults under
which England and America have groaned, from the fatal
moment in which this senseless committee conceived the
extravagant idea of drawing a revenue from the colonies,
by taxing subjects in a house where they had no representatives.
Thank heaven I have no reproach to make to
myself. I opposed, in the time of it, this horrible measure,
and predicted the fatal effects, and I have the chagrin to
see all my predictions accomplished; from error to error,
from one false measure to another, we are arrived to the
brink of a precipice, down to the bottom of which we feel
ourselves irresistibly hurried by the weight of our debts.</p>

<p>"From the time that the word independence, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
from America, resounded in this house, we have endeavored
to evince that the Americans had originally this independence
in view. Nevertheless, the events have demonstrated
that nothing was further from their idea. When
I express myself thus, I speak of Americans in general. I
pretend not to insinuate, that there were not among them
some men of inferior rank, who have thought that they saw
their present interest in the independence of their country.
In so vast a country it is impossible, that there should not
be found some such senseless men, and I should be more
senseless, more absurd, than the absurdest of them all, if I
could doubt of it a moment. But again, once more; the
mass of the nation did not aim at independence; when we
had forced this peaceable people to a just resistance, what
happened here? Our lawyers opened the road of error;
we never inquired how we could appease these rising troubles.
Grave men, distinguished by the most eminent
talents, and by the most influential offices, talked of conquest
and submission; 'The Rubicon is passed,' said they,
'the sword is drawn, it you do not kill them they will kill
you.' The lawyers were powerfully seconded by the
reverend ministers of a religion, which teaches peace and
recommends brotherly love. The robe and the mitre, animating
us in concert to massacre, we plunged ourselves
into rivers of blood, spreading terror, devastation, and
death over the whole continent of America, exhausting ourselves
at home both of men and money, dishonoring forever
our annals, we became the objects of horror in the
eyes of indignant Europe! It was our reverend prelates
who led on this dance, which may be justly styled the
dance of death! These reverend prelates have a terrible
account to give to their country and to their consciences;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
they have opened upon them the eyes of the nation, who
have justly styled them the rotten part of the constitution.</p>

<p>"Such is the horrid war, which we have maintained for
five years. What have been its horrible fruits! a ruinous
war to sustain against the two branches of the House of
Bourbon; we are crushed under the burden of an immense
debt; at war with America; at war with France; at war
with Spain, without having a single ally or a single power
for our friend. On the contrary, seeing distinctly and
without doubt, that all foreign powers act directly or indirectly,
in a manner absolutely contrary to our interests, not
to say in a hostile manner, there are none, even down
to the little inhabitants of Lubeck, of Dantzic, and of Hamburg,
who are not against us! This is not all. What
is much worse still, we see Holland, our natural ally, opposed
to our interests, and refusing us the slightest succor.
We are precisely at this moment the deer marked out for
the chase, detached by the blood hounds from the rest of
the flock which abandons us! If our situation is terrible,
we need not believe, that the Americans repose themselves
upon beds of roses; far from it, and it is from the bosom of
their distress that the ray of hope issues, which in my opinion
shines upon us at this day. We have forced them to
contract an alliance with France; this alliance was not natural;
nature, habit, language, and religion, all conspire to
raise a barrier between France and America; all tend to
bind again, between England and America, the natural ties
heretofore fortunate and happy. The Americans have not
found in their great and good ally, the friend that they
sought in him; they have a natural aversion even for the
title of a King. They prefer the republican institutions to
absolute monarchy; they are overloaded with an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
debt, the burden of which France has not appeared forward
to lighten for them. Their paper money is fallen to
such a degree of depreciation, that they have given forty
dollars in paper for one dollar in silver, worth four shillings
and sixpence. The greatest part among them, groan under
the tyranny of those, who have made themselves masters
of power, desiring ardently the restoration of the ancient
form of government; their troops ill paid, and still worse
clothed, have been reduced to such dreadful extremities,
that the last summer, in the course of a fatiguing march,
they saw themselves reduced to the ration of a handful of
pease a day; as for the rest, their allies know as much
upon this point as we. A Frenchman, distinguished by
his talents, sent some years ago by his Court to America
to observe the disposition of the people and the state of
things, &amp;c. in a letter, which he wrote from the place of
his destination, serves himself of these remarkable expressions;
'one shall find in a coffee-house of Paris a great
deal more enthusiasm for the cause of liberty, than in any
part of America.'</p>

<p>"Let us take advantage of these circumstances. Let
us put an end to the war of America, to the end that we
may unite more efficaciously all our efforts against the
House of Bourbon. I believe we shall not find much hostility.
France has not gained, Spain has considerably lost,
let us strike both the one and the other more decisive blows.
We cannot do this without making peace with America.
We cannot obtain this peace but by offering reasonable
terms of reconciliation. I have maturely examined all
which has been proposed before me. I have come as near
as possible to the plan of conciliation, drawn by the Earl
of Chatham. I may say, indeed, that I have taken it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
my model. But I have departed from it in the most
essential point. The Earl of Chatham's bill had for its
foundation this express condition, that America should acknowledge
the sovereignty of Great Britain, and that each
assembly should furnish to the mass of the public revenue
a certain quota. Certainly, if we were to make at this
day to America a similar proposition, they would laugh in
our faces, and would treat those who should dare to make
it, as smartly as they treated the Commissioners, who visited
her in 1778. The great object of my bill is, that
something certain should be done, which may be proper to
convince America of the sincerity of those views, with
which we invite her to enter into some conciliatory convention
with his Majesty. In one word, the title of my
bill is an analysis of it;&mdash;<em>A Bill to appease the Troubles,
which have sometime subsisted between Great Britain and
America, and to authorise his Majesty to send Commissioners,
clothed with full Powers to treat with America.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 23d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The public papers announce, that all the maritime powers
have acceded to the proposition of Russia respecting
an armed neutrality.</p>

<p>The following article from Stockholm is of the 2d of
May. "Our Court has accepted the plan of an armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
neutrality, which the Empress of all the Russias has proposed
to it; and in consequence has given orders to equip
six more ships of the line; so that our naval force will consist,
like that of Denmark, of six ships of the line and six
frigates, whereof six vessels of war will remain in the port
of Carlserona, equipped and ready to be employed, on the
first order."</p>

<p>The article from Copenhagen is of the 9th of May.
"The Court has acceded to the proposition of her Majesty
the Empress of Russia, in regard to an armed neutrality,
and in consequence, they are busy in taking measures for
the armament. Besides the four vessels of the line and the
two frigates, which they equipped, the Court have further
put in commission two other ships of the line, the Jylland
of ten guns, and the Mars of sixty, and they are taking all
possible pains both here and in Norway, and in the other
Provinces of this kingdom, to recruit the number of men
necessary for this armament. Two of our ships of the line,
the Wagrien and the Infods, passed into the Road last
Saturday. The same day Captain Ziervogel, commanding
a frigate, set sail with the officers and crews necessary
to bring here the two frigates, which are at Fredericksham
in Norway. The Russian ships of war, Captain Spendof,
who has wintered here, and the frigate of the same nation,
which was upon its return from Norway, set sail yesterday
for Petersburg."</p>

<p>There is another article from Paris of the 12th of May.
"The Court of Portugal," they say, "has given assurance
to ours of arming if necessary to maintain the neutrality,
and by means of the accession of this Power to the system
it appears, that there can remain little hope to England of
finding an ally, who will make a common cause with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and aid her to preserve the empire of the seas, of which
she flattered herself she would never be dispossessed."</p>

<p>Another article from Hamburg of the 12th of May.
"At a time, when there is an extraordinary dearth of news,
our politicians occupy themselves about the declaration of
the Court of Russia to the belligerent Powers, and the proposition
of this same Court to the neutral Powers. Already,
they say, it is no longer doubtful, that the Courts of Sweden,
of Denmark, and the States-General of the United
Provinces, have acceded to the proposition of the Empress
of Russia, and that they arm themselves. It is now the
problem, to know if the Court of Portugal will follow their
example. In the meantime, our speculators appear in general
very curious to know, what will be the measures, which
the neutral Powers will take for the execution of their designs,
and at what time the plan of this armed neutrality can
have its effect."</p>

<p>Another is an article from London of the 12th of May.
"The day before yesterday, the Court received despatches
from its Ministers in the Northern Courts, which confirm
the news of a plan of confederation formed by the Powers
of that part of Europe, for the protection of their respective
subjects against the attacks of the belligerent Powers.
The despatches of Sir Joseph Yorke announce, they say,
an approaching negotiation between the Court of London
and the States-General, to the end to adjust amicably the
difference arisen between the two nations, relative to the
capture of some Dutch vessels, and the insult offered to
the flag of the Republic, by Commodore Fielding. It is
believed, that this affair will be terminated to the mutual
satisfaction of the two parties, and that this negotiation may
well serve to pave the way to a reconciliation among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 26th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>At a numerous assembly of gentlemen of the law in
Dublin, held the 30th of April, Captain Henry Hewart in
the chair, after having collected the votes, Henry Grattan
was unanimously admitted an honorary member; and it
was agreed with the same unanimity, that the following address
should be presented to him.</p>

<p>"Sir;&mdash;The body of the gentlemen of the law, ambitious
of associating to themselves a man, whom they
consider as an ornament of his country, and as the firm
support of her rights, unanimously prays you to accept the
title of honorary member of the society, as an unequivocal
testimony of their admiration of vast talents when they are
displayed in the cause of liberty and virtue. They request
you, particularly, to accept of their most affectionate
thanks for the noble effort, that in concurrence with several
of the most respectable persons in the kingdom, you
made on Wednesday, the 19th current, in defence of the
rights of the people, and in endeavoring to unite the British
Empire; they assure you, that although the event has
not entirely answered, either to their expectations or to
the nobleness of your efforts, they are firmly determined
to sustain their rights, such as they are laid down in the
resolutions, which you have proposed. They esteem it
happy to see, that without excepting even the servants of
the Crown, all the members of the House have acknowledged
the truth of the principle upon which those resolutions
stood, although the majority has not accepted them,
alleging, that at this critical time it was not necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
renew the declarations already standing on the journals of
the House and subsisting in full force."</p>

<p>To this address, Mr Grattan made the following reply.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen;&mdash;I esteem myself infinitely honored to be
a member of an association, which has merited for a long
time my attention and my admiration. By declaring that
there is no power capable of subjecting this country, but
the King, the Peers, and Commons of Ireland, you render
a great service to this nation, because you give to all the
other corps of volunteers the great example, to make the
same declaration of their rights under the sanction of your
corps, who not only protect the nation in arms, but by
your knowledge and authority, propagate the great principles
of law and liberty.</p>

<p>"In a country which possesses laws like ours, and men
of your merit agitate the great question of liberty, it is to
be free. I rejoice then that the rights of Ireland have been
discussed. This discussion has opened the eyes of a
people, who had slept during the course of a century, and
forced almost all the representatives of this people, who are
susceptible of principle, to deny that any foreign legislature
has rights over Ireland; and makes this declaration circulate
through all the great associations of the kingdom, and
will finally extirpate all that remains of authority usurped
by the British Parliament.</p>

<p>"I observe, with satisfaction, that you think like me,
that liberty is the tie which preserves the union of Great
Britain and Ireland. We are attached to Great Britain,
but not to its yoke. Common privileges formed originally
our connexion with Great Britain; these same privileges
will render this connexion indissoluble. If Ireland acknowledged
as a slave the supremacy of the British Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
she would be the enemy of British liberty, because
in that case she would league herself with the Ministers
to annihilate the system of government, and precipitate
all the subjects of his Majesty into a state of equality.</p>

<p>"I regard the liberty of Ireland as adding to the safety
of that of Great Britain, which, instead of protestations of
loyalty extorted from a Province devoted to pillage, will
actually receive a tribute of affection sensibly felt on the
part of a free people. As a friend of the constitutions
of the two kingdoms, as desirous of an honorable and
permanent union, I esteem myself happy to see myself
enrolled among men, who have your courage and your
principles."</p>

<p>On the 13th of April, the British frigate the Hyæna,
Captain Thompson, arrived at Gibraltar at midnight, having
escaped the fire of three batteries, three chebecs
of twentyeight guns each, and a frigate of thirtytwo.
Don Barcelo, in the Spanish Admiral, pursued him in a
fifty gun ship. The Don's squadron consists of six ships
of the line, one frigate of thirtytwo guns, three chebecs of
twentyeight guns each, and a number of fire-ships and gallies,
which intercept all which pass the Gut, and completely
blockade Gibraltar, and the squadron of Commodore Elliot,
reduced to the Panther, the Enterprise, and three
smaller vessels. The garrison is said to be in good spirits,
although a malignant fever brought in by the Spanish prisoners
has carried off a great many men, particularly in
the regiment of Highlanders. The wants of the garrison,
however, will soon be very great, particularly of fuel.
Captain Thompson carried the news, that they are soon to
have a powerful succor from Admiral Graves. It is very
probable, that the Ministry may send Graves to attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
act over again the part of Admiral Rodney, and after
throwing assistance into Gibraltar, pass on to America.
It is to be hoped, that Graves will not have Rodney's luck.
It is pretty certain he has not all his dexterity. Yet I
cannot but think the Spaniards are imprudently exposed in
that part. The English have filled all the newspapers of
Europe for three weeks, with lists of ships of the line to
compose the grand fleet in the channel, which they have
made amount to forty. But at last comes out a frank
and honest confession in the Courier de l'Europe, that
they can muster but twenty.</p>

<p>On the 16th, Admiral Edwards hoisted his flag at
Portsmouth, on board the Portland, of fifty guns, and
made the signal of departure for all the merchant ships
which he is to convey to the Banks of Newfoundland. Sir
Charles Hardy, commander-in-chief of the channel fleet,
Governor of Greenwich hospital, and a representative of
Plymouth, is dead. Rivingston is next in command, but
it is said the place of commander-in-chief will be offered
to Admiral &mdash;&mdash; who refused it before Hardy was appointed.</p>

<p>We read from Hamburg, 19th of May. "Conversation
here turns wholly upon the plan of an armed neutrality,
proposed by the Empress of Russia, and the more we examine,
the more we are convinced of the great advantages,
which this plan will procure, not only for the present, but
the future. In the meantime we learn, that the neutral
powers will not delay to put to sea strong squadrons to protect
their commerce, and it is even pretended, that if the
English continue to molest neutral ships, it may well happen
in a little time, that they may form against them some
enterprise of consequence. It is assured, that the Hanseatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
towns have acceded to the armed neutrality proposed.
It is reported, that conferences between the maritime powers
will be held at the Hague, and that they will be
opened as soon as the Baron d'Erensworth, the new Minister
of the King of Sweden to their High Mightinesses,
shall arrive there. They say in London, that the Baron
de Nolker, Minister of Sweden, has presented to the
Court a memorial containing very lively complaints, touching
the hostilities committed by an English vessel against
the Swedish vessel the Illerim, commanded by the Chevalier
d'Ankerlo, in which this Minister demands satisfaction
for the violences committed against the said ship. They
add, that his Excellency at the same time declared, that
the King, his master, was resolved to defend and maintain
with his arms in his hand the system of neutrality adopted
by his Majesty."</p>

<p>They say too, in London 16th of May, that government
have had the satisfaction to learn, that the convoy from
Cork and from Plymouth, consisting in merchant ships,
and a considerable reinforcement of troops, although dispersed
after their departure, had arrived in the West India
Islands.</p>

<p><em>Paris, 16th of May.</em> "Divers advices announce, that
the English, since the declaration made to the States-General
of the United Provinces, have already stopped several
Dutch ships, loaded only with innocent merchandises, and
whereof the transportation has never been prohibited to
neutrals by the treaties. This arbitrary proceeding will
appear, without doubt, so much the more surprising to the
maritime powers of the North, as at the same time his
Majesty, always guided by the principles of wisdom and
the most exact equity, has sent the strictest orders to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the commandants and captains of his vessels of war, and
privateers of his kingdom, to let pass freely and without
any hinderance all the neutral vessels, without distinction,
even although bound to an enemy's port, provided they
are not loaded with any arms, or warlike stores, whereof
the transportation is forbidden by the treaties. Of this
we may be assured more authentically by a letter written
by M. de Sartine to M. de Mistral, Commissary General
of the ports and arsenals of the Marine of the King, and
Ordonnateur of the port of Havre, which is of the following
tenor.</p>

<p>'You know, Sir, that the war undertaken by the King
has no other end but the desire, with which his Majesty
feels himself animated for the maintenance of the liberty of
navigation. In consequence, he has seen with a great deal
of pleasure, that the greatest part of the powers of the
North incline, and have taken the resolution to co-operate
in it already, by regulations relative to it, as his Majesty
has made known to the commanders of his squadrons, his
intentions relative to the measures and precautions, which
the captains of his vessels of war, and other vessels ought
to observe towards ships belonging to the subjects of the
neutral powers, and which the former may meet at sea.</p>

<p>'His Majesty then has charged me to repeat his orders
given in this regard, and to order you to exhort the captains
and other officers of vessels armed as privateers to
conform themselves with more attention than ever to the
tenor of the regulations relative to neutral vessels, and in
particular to those belonging to the Russians. To this
end, his Majesty orders the captains of vessels armed for
privateering, and others, to use the greatest circumspection
toward all neutral vessels, and according to the exigence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of the case, to afford them all the assistance of which they
may stand in need, not to give the least hinderance to their
navigation, although their cargoes may be destined for the
enemy's ports, nor to stop them, except in cases in which
the captains of French armed vessels shall have well
founded reasons to believe, that the said vessels navigate
for the subjects of the King of England, under the shelter
of the flag of a neutral power, to the end to avoid by this
way the being visited according to the usages established
in such cases, or in which they shall attempt to transport
to the enemy the effects of contraband, such as arms of all
kinds, and other warlike stores.</p>

<p>'The intention of the King is, that you give notice of
these presents to the Commissaries of the Department of
Havre de Grace, ordering them, at the same time, to send
copies to all the captains of vessels armed as privateers,
and other vessels ready to go out, or who come in, to the
end that they conform themselves with the greatest circumspection
to what is here prescribed in regard to neutral
vessels, and in particular to those belonging to Russia.'"</p>

<p>They write from Brest the 8th of this month, that they
expected a fleet from Bordeaux, loaded with stores, provisions,
and wine, the arrival of which was very necessary
for the prompt equipment of a squadron destined to transport
a second division of troops, of four or five thousand
men. They add, that they expect also, with no less impatience
in the same port, the convoy, which went out from
St Malo, the 23d of March, which is still detained at Cherbourg,
which consists in a great measure in cast cannon
and artillery stores, which are to serve, they say, for a descent,
which is projected in England, and which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
strongly asserted the government has by no means renounced.
The latter part is probably only what we call a
scarecrow.</p>

<p><em>Hague, 21st of May.</em> "We see here a copy of a letter
written by his Excellency the Count de Florida Blanca,
Secretary of State of his Catholic Majesty, to the Count
de Rechteren, Minister of their High Mightinesses at the
Court of Spain, dated at Aranjues, the 1st of May, 1780,
which is of the following tenor.</p>

<p>"Sir;&mdash;His Majesty has learned, that the boat of a chebeck,
commanded by Don Barthelemi Rosello, having
seized a Dutch vessel, named the Spaar, Captain John
Tierds Wagenaar, coming out of Gibraltar, where he had
unloaded a cargo of flour, which he was carrying from
Ferrol to Cadiz; on account of the purveyors of our Marine
the said vessel has been set at liberty, upon the declaration
which he made, that he had been taken under Cape
Espartel, by the English privateer, the Maidstone, who
had conducted him to that place. Nevertheless, we have
proofs that the vessel has been met at the entrance of the
port of Cadiz, having at that time her cargo; that by consequence,
her pretended capture by the English privateer
is a pure fiction, and the introduction into Gibraltar of a
load of five thousand one hundred and sixtytwo and a
quarter quintals of castile of flour, a manifest theft committed
upon the provisions of the Marine of the King; and to
the end that such villanies may be punished and prevented
hereafter, his Majesty has ordained, that a prosecution be
commenced against the said Wagenaar, and that I give
you notice of it, to the end, that you may inform their
High Mightinesses, to whom his Minister at the Hague has
orders to complain highly of a theft, which ought not to
have been the fruit of the complaisance, which the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
has used towards the flag of the Republic. I shall add,
that his Majesty hopes that their High Mightinesses by the
remedy, which they shall provide, and by the severe punishment
of the guilty, will spare him the pain of taking
himself the precautions necessary to suppress such crying
excesses."</p>

<p>In the Hague Gazette of the 24th of May, is the following
article from London, of the 19th of May. "On the
17th, the King returned from Windsor to St James, and
assisted at a great council. The conduct of several Courts
of Europe, in the present conjuncture, excites all the attention
of our Ministry; we foresee here what will be the
effects of an armed neutrality, and we fear that there will
result from it consequences dangerous to the general repose
of Europe. There are persons, nevertheless, who pretend
to foresee, that this decision of the neutral powers will produce
events, which will facilitate an accommodation between
the belligerent powers, but that there will be no
question about it, until after that France and Spain shall
have made all their efforts to take away from England the
empire of the seas, and procure to Europe an entire liberty
of commerce, two points on which they found their present
hostilities, and which serve as attractions to excite other
powers to enter into their views. England, on her part,
will employ all her forces to maintain her superiority at
sea, on which depends the prosperity of this country, and
the safety of its detached dominions; and although her
enemies are numerous and formidable, she is not without
hopes, that the present campaign will bring back the Colonies
of America to their ancient relations of interest, and
dispose the powers at war to hearken to conditions of accommodation."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, May 27th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>In the beginning of this controversy with Great Britain,
the Americans made such extensive researches into the
principles of the British constitution, and into those controversies
which had taken place in former ages, concerning
their application to external dominions in Ireland, Scotland,
Wales, Gascoine, Guienne, Jersey, Guernsy, Man,
&amp;c. and published the result of their inquiries to the world,
which were read with avidity everywhere, that I consider
those publications as having laid the foundation of most of
the events that have happened since. The proceedings of
Ireland in 1779 and 1780 may be read in some publications
made in America in 1774 or 1775. I have long expected
to see something produced by the same principles
in the East Indies, and at last I find I am not disappointed.
In the General Advertiser of May 13th is this paragraph.</p>

<p>"We are authorised to correct the account, that appeared
in this paper on last Thursday, concerning the petitions
lately arrived from the East Indies. It is not true, that the
British inhabitants of Bengal have sent over a petition to
his Majesty to abolish the Court of Judicature established
there. Their petition is addressed, and will shortly be
presented to Parliament; and so far from wishing to abolish
the court of justice, they only pray that its constitutional
powers may be restrained. The grand object of their petition
is, to obtain 'a trial by jury in all cases, where it is by
law established in England,' which they conceive is one of
those inherent, unalienable, and indefeasible rights, of which
neither time nor circumstance can deprive a British subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
living, under British laws, and which the Judges in
Bengal have lately ventured to declare they are not entitled
to, except in criminal cases.</p>

<p>"The prayer of the Persian petitions already presented
to one of the Secretaries of State, from the natives of different
districts in the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and
Orissa, is, we understand, to be relieved from the hardships
they suffer by the establishment of the English Court
of Judicature. They express, in the strongest language,
their distress and terror at the extraordinary powers assumed
and exercised by the judges. They pray to be
exempted from the jurisdiction of a court, to whose rules
they are utter strangers, and from the control of laws,
which they consider as calculated for a different state of
society, and which are abhorrent to the manners, institutions,
and religion of their forefathers."</p>

<p>If this war continues, we shall hear more of the East
Indies and their claims. Great Britain holds them by a
slender thread, and by the good will only of a few individuals.</p>

<p>Among the English papers, which I enclose to Congress,
will be found a Dialogue in the Shades between the Duke
of Devonshire, the Earl of Chatham, and Mr Charles
York. It was written by Edward Jennings, of Maryland,
now residing at Brussels, a gentleman of great merit.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 1st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>This morning a friend at Versailles sent me two English
papers of the 26th and 27th of May, containing Rodney's
account of an action between the French and English
fleets on the 17th of April. At the conclusion of the battle,
says Rodney, the enemy might be said to be completely
beat. How easy it is to say and write this! Much
easier than to find a sufficient number of persons ready to
believe it. Such was the distance of the van and the rear
from the centre, and the crippled condition of several ships,
particularly the Sandwich, which for twentyfour hours was
with difficulty kept above water, that it was impossible to
pursue them that night without the greatest disadvantage.
He found it in vain to follow them with his Majesty's fleet,
in the condition they were in, to Guadaloupe, and accordingly
put away to Fort Royal Bay, Martinique, there to
wait for them.</p>

<p>The French Admiral appeared to Rodney a brave and
gallant officer, and was nobly supported during the whole
action. The killed on board the English fleet were one
hundred and twenty, the wounded, three hundred and fiftythree;
four hundred and seventythree in all. These circumstances
are very far from giving authenticity to the
idea, that the French were beaten. It has every appearance
of a third general drawn battle, in which the English
have ultimately the worst. Drawn battles do not maintain
the empire, the dominion, the sovereignty, the mastership
of the seas. To all these they pretend, and they must
make good their pretensions by clear victories, or they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
undone. The French Court has not yet received any account.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 1st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>In consequence of an advertisement published to this
effect, the corporation of the citizens of Dublin, having assembled
on the 11th of May, at Thalsel, the committee
named the 29th of February last, to prepare and present
resolutions relative to the affairs of the times, made the following
report, which was unanimously approved.</p>

<p>"We, members of the committee appointed at a general
meeting of the citizens; held the 29th of last February,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
having taken into consideration the objects, the examination
of which was committed to us, submit to our fellow
citizens the following resolution.</p>

<p>"That we think, that it is the absolute duty of every virtuous
citizen to declare, in the most explicit manner, what
he thinks relatively to the great constitutional objects,
which have been suspended in the moment when we expected
it the least, as well as to co-operate with courage
and unanimity in everything which can tend to the acquisition
of these same objects. That our sincere desire is,
to maintain an inviolable connexion between Great Britain
and Ireland, to establish and fix this connexion upon the
only basis which can render it stable and permanent; that
of a royalty inseparable from the common rights of an
equal liberty. That it is at this time necessary to declare,
that the King, the Peers, and Commons of Ireland, are
the only powers to which it belongs to make laws for binding
this kingdom.</p>

<p>"That in putting in use all the constitutional means,
whatever be the public or private character with which we
may be clothed, whether we are magistrates, jurors, or
simple individuals, we will maintain and propagate these
principles, and we will adhere invariably to the great and
important objects of our instructions, those of establishing
the independence of the Parliament of Ireland, and of obtaining
a modification of Poyning's law.</p>

<p>"That all the plans of reformation, which may be proposed,
are necessarily vain and of no effect, while the influence
of the Crown, arising from the profusion with
which the people bestow their grants, and from the imprudent
prodigality of Ministers, shall not be diminished;
and that we ought constantly to employ our efforts to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a system of retrenchment and economy, to the end
the better to diminish the means of corruption.</p>

<p>"That the independent electors of Ireland, are particularly
called upon to make their efforts to procure for the
nation more virtuous representatives, more equality in the
representation of the people in Parliament, and to study the
most effectual measures to obtain these desirable ends. We
think that the said electors cannot better succeed, than by
refusing with firmness to vote for any man, provided either
with places or pensions, or who shall have acted in any
manner contrary to the inherent rights or manifest sentiments
of the people; and by giving for instructions to
their representatives to make all their exertions to obtain
an augmentation in the number of members, who represent
the counties, the populous cities, and the independent
towns.</p>

<p>"That we pledge ourselves to each other, and all to our
country, by all which men know that is sacred, to take
the foregoing resolutions for the rule of our conduct, and
that at all opportunities, and by all constitutional means,
we will support the spirit and principles of them. In testimony
of this solemn declaration, we have all signed the
said resolutions.</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved unanimously</em>, That the said resolutions thus
signed by the members of the committee, shall be deposited
in the coffee-house, at the Royal Exchange, there to
receive the signatures of the citizens."</p>


<p class="center"><em>Continuation of said Report.</em></p>

<p>"We, members of the committee, &amp;c. propose further
to our fellow-citizens the following resolutions.</p>

<p>"That our sincere thanks be presented, in the most respectful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
manner to Henry Grattan, for the motion, excellently
well conceived, which he has made in Parliament
the 19th of April last, tending to a declaration, that his
most excellent Majesty the King, the Peers, and Commons
of Ireland, are the only power to which it belongs to
make laws capable of binding this kingdom.</p>

<p>"That thanks also be presented to the ninetyeight members,
which supported this great constitutional assertion;
passed unanimously.</p>

<p>"That our sincere thanks be presented, in the most respectful
manner, to Barry Yelverton, for the patriotic motion
which he made in Parliament the 25th of last April,
to the end to introduce regulations concerning the manner
in which bills are transmitted from this kingdom to England.
The object of this motion being to hinder the unconstitutional
interposition of the privy council, in obtaining
the modification so much desired of Poyning's law.</p>

<p>"That thanks be given also to the one hundred and six
members who seconded this manly effort; passed unanimously.</p>

<p>"That our sincere thanks be presented to our worthy
representatives, Doctor William Clement and Sir Samuel
Bradstreet, Baronet, on account of the uniformity of their
conduct in Parliament, and particularly for the zeal with
which they have supported the two important motions
aforesaid; conforming themselves in this to the late instructions,
which they have received from us, and seconding
the general wish of this kingdom; passed unanimously.</p>

<p>"That our sincere thanks, and full of gratitude, be presented
in the most respectful manner to the noble Lords
who have opposed, and to those who had the courage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
protest against the last paragraph of the address, which the
House of Peers presented to the throne, the 2d of March,
last. The said paragraph containing insinuations, which
were neither founded upon facts nor authorised by actions,
implying reproaches, which the people of Ireland have not
merited, and contained in these words; 'that they would
use all possible endeavors to discourage and disappoint all
endeavors, which ill advised men may employ to the end to
excite ill founded fears in the minds of the people of his
Majesty, or to divert their attention from those advantages
relative to commerce, which have been granted to us in so
great an extent;' passed with three negatives.</p>

<p>"That we earnestly request our magistrates not to give,
in any manner nor on any occasion, any effect to any law,
which does not proceed from, or has not received the
sanction of the King, the Peers, and Commons of Ireland.
That while they conduct themselves thus, they shall receive
from us the most constant and the most firm support,
to the end to annihilate the ill founded hope, which may
have been conceived, of subjecting Ireland in any case to
a foreign legislation; passed unanimously.</p>

<p>"That it is the opinion of this committee, that the two
great and favorite objects of the people, viz. a declaration
of its rights and a modification of Poyning's law, having
been suspended in Parliament in a manner so unexpected,
it appears at this time of absolute necessity to
form a committee of correspondence, to the end to co-operate
with such other committees of the same nature as
may be formed in the kingdom, in the measures the most
proper to give extension and safety to the advantages relative
to commerce, which we have at last obtained; to
restore still further our rights and liberties, and to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the constitution of Ireland free and independent;
passed with one negative."</p>

<p>The committee of correspondence was named upon the
spot, and formed of fifteen members.</p>

<p>Thus a new epoch is formed in the politics of Ireland;
hitherto they had left the supreme direction of affairs in
the hands of Parliament. The people have now taken it
into their own hands. The committee of Dublin, by communicating
with other committees through the kingdom,
will be able to conduct the body of the kingdom, and unite
the various parts of it in certain principles, which will by
degrees work themselves into a system, and complete the independence
of Irish legislation. This will depend, however,
upon the continuance of the war; for if England should be
wise enough to make peace, of which there is little probability,
the spirit of Ireland will evaporate, and their beautiful
edifice dissolve, like the fabric of a vision.</p>

<p>"The undersigned, merchants, assurers, and owners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
vessels, and freighters, established in these Provinces, give
respectfully to understand, that it is with sentiments of the
most sensible gratitude, that the Commerce has been informed
of the affectionate resolution taken by your High
Mightinesses to equip a number of vessels of war to the
end to protect the free navigation of the subjects of this
State. But as the petitioners were ignorant, that the activity
of the progress of the said equipment has to this
time been retarded, both by the sickness, which prevails
among the crews of the vessels ready to put to sea, and
by the want of experienced seamen, necessary to the
equipment of vessels put into commission, and by other
causes; while in this interval the most favorable season for
navigation slips away, many ships loaded with merchandises
dare not set sail from the ports of this country, for
want of the necessary protection; while they cannot find
means here, nor elsewhere, of insuring but a small portion
of those vessels and their cargoes, and that, even at enormous
premiums, such as have never before been demanded,
being from twenty to thirty per cent, which occasions
an interruption and an inactivity to their navigation so excessive
as well as to their commerce, that their total ruin
must necessarily result from it; all the commissions for
merchandises passing elsewhere, without a hope of being
able ever to see them return here, which an unfortunate
experience has already many times proved. For these
causes, the petitioners humbly pray, that it may please
your High Mightinesses, to grant and effectuate as soon as
possible the protection necessary; as the commercial interest
on their part are ready to co-operate effectually, to
complete the crews, and to submit to all prompt and convenient
measures, which, according to the exigence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
case, and the urgent circumstances your High Mightinesses,
according to your enlightened wisdom, shall judge to
be the most proper for the preservation of the commerce
and the navigation of your subjects."</p>

<p>The second petition is as follows.</p>

<p>"To their Noble and Grand Mightinesses, our Lords,
the States of Holland and West Friesland.</p>

<p>"The subscribing merchants, assurers, owners of ships,
and freighters, all living in these Provinces, give respectfully
to understand, that the petitioners pressed by the
urgent necessity, and to the end to ward off the total ruin
of commerce and navigation, without which neither they
nor the greater part of the inhabitants of the Republic can
subsist, have addressed themselves to your High Mightinesses,
our Lords, the States-General of the United Provinces,
to solicit a prompt protection, by the way of petition,
of which the petitioners have the honor to annex a copy.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, although the petitioners have every reason
to flatter themselves, that an arrangement equally ready
and efficacious, will soon fulfil their wishes; nevertheless,
the better to complete their views, and for the preservation
of commerce and navigation, the soul and the nerve of the
prosperity of the Republic, and to the end to prevent its
inaction, as well as the total ruin of the petitioners, which
would infallibly follow, they think that it would be very
necessary, that it may please your Noble and Grand
Mightinesses, to second in this the petitioners, as in your
high wisdom you shall judge expedient and convenient."</p>

<p>I have before sent a copy of what was published for the
answer of the Court of Madrid to the Russian Declaration.
But, as that Court has now published an authentic
copy, which is a little different from that, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
more clear and better, I beg leave to trouble Congress with
a translation of it.</p>

<p>"The King has been informed of the fashion of thinking
of the Empress of Russia, in regard to the powers,
both belligerent and neuter, by a Memorial, which M. Stephen
de Zinowioff, Minister of that sovereign, has presented
on the 15th of this month, to the Count de Florida
Blanca, first Secretary of State. The King considers this
act of the Empress, as an effect of the just confidence,
which his Majesty has merited on his part; and it is to
him so much the more agreeable, as the principles adopted
by this sovereign are those which have ever governed the
King, and which his Majesty endeavored, by all possible
means, although without effect, to induce England to observe,
during the time that Spain herself was neuter.
These principles are those of justice, of equity, and of
moderation; these same principles in fine, Russia, and all
the powers have acknowledged in the resolutions of his
Majesty; and it is only by the conduct, which the English
navy has established, both in the last and present war, (a
conduct, which subverts the rules the most constantly observed
in regard to neutral powers) that his Majesty has
seen himself under the necessity of imitating it; because
the English not respecting the neutral flag, when it had on
board the effects of an enemy, although they were not
contraband, and this flag not defending itself against these
violences, they could not, with justice, hinder Spain from
using equal reprisals, to secure herself from the enormous
prejudice, which would result from an inequality in this
respect.</p>

<p>"The neutral powers, on their side, have also given occasion
to the inconveniences, which they have suffered, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
having served themselves with double papers, and other
artifices, to the end to prevent the capture of their vessels.
From this have followed the numerous captures and detentions,
as well as the consequences, which have resulted
from them; although in truth, these have not been so prejudicial
as has been pretended. On the contrary, we
know, that some of these detentions have turned to the advantage
of the owners of the cargoes; the provisions, of
which they were composed, having been sold in the port
where the ships were tried, at a price higher than the price
current at the place of their destination.</p>

<p>"The King, nevertheless, not content with these proofs
of his justification, manifested to the eyes of all Europe,
would at this day have the glory of being the first to give
the example of respecting the neutral flag of all the
Courts, which have consented, or which shall consent, to
defend it, until his Majesty shall see the part, which the
English navy shall take, and until he shall discover, by experience,
whether this navy will restrain itself or not, as
well as the English privateers. And to this end to make
it appear to all the powers how ready Spain is to observe,
now she is at war, the same rules, which she desired
while she was neuter, his Majesty conforms himself to the
other points contained in the declaration of Russia, it being
well understood, that what concerns the place blockaded,
of Gibraltar, the danger of entering into that subsists
in the manner in which this point is ascertained by the
fourth article of the said declaration, by the means of the
number of vessels stationed there to form the blockade;
a danger, however, which the neutral vessels may avoid,
by conforming to the rules of precaution established in the
declaration of his Majesty, of the 13th of March last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
which has been communicated to the Court of Petersburg
by the means of its Minister.</p>

<p>There are two articles worth translating from the foreign
gazettes, if it were only as specimens of the art, which is
employed to keep the enemy in uncertainty about the designs
of this Court, and the destinations of their fleets,
whether successfully or not.</p>

<p>The first is, Amsterdam, 29th of May. A letter from
Toulon, of the 8th of this month, contains the following details.
"Orders have arrived here from Court, to send out
into the Road, as soon as may be, the ships of the line,
the Zélé and the Marseillois; but as the destination of
these two ships is kept extremely secret, we exhaust ourselves
in conjectures concerning the object of the operations,
which they are ordered to execute. Some will have
it, that they have orders to go and join the squadron of
Don Solano, which sailed from Cadiz the 28th of last
month, which it is pretended is bound to Brest. Others
presume, that they have no other commission, than to go
and cruise in the neighborhood of Mahon, to keep in the
privateers, which frequently come out from thence, and
which give extreme trouble to the navigation of the ports
of the Mediterranean; in fine, there are some who believe
that these vessels are to co-operate in an important enterprise,
which is to be attempted in that sea. However this
may be, as we know that a number of vessels have been
taken up upon freight, on account of the King, and that
they may easily embark in our port eleven or twelve thousand
men; as moreover, it is more than probable that on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the one hand, the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar being
sufficiently guarded by the Spaniards, so that there will
not be occasion for a strong squadron to protect the transport
vessels, which may be employed in an expedition
against Mahon; and that on the other hand, the English
being sufficiently occupied on diverse sides, may not be
able easily to send to the relief of this island, we conclude
from the combination of these different circumstances, that
it may very well happen, that they may attempt this conquest,
the success of which does not appear in effect to
present any very insurmountable difficulties, and which
would procure, after all, an advantage sufficiently important
to the good of our commerce in general to merit that
at least we should make the essay."</p>

<p>The other article is in the Amsterdam Gazette of the
30th of May, and from Paris the 23d of May, 1780.</p>

<p>"We are of opinion here, that M. de Ternay is ordered
to conduct the division of M. de Rochambeau to Canada,
and that with so much the more foundation, as we see
everywhere what M. de Sartine has published of the despatches
of the Count de Guichen, that the arrival of his
squadron in the seas of the Antilles, was sufficient to give
us there a decided superiority. We cannot, moreover,
but applaud the prudence of M. de Guichen and M. de
Bouillé, in not sacrificing, perhaps in vain, a great many
lives, to expel the English from the island of St Lucia,
these two Generals having, without doubt, designs more
important, and the success of which appears to them more
certain, which naturally raises conjectures, that M. de
Guichen proposed very soon to put to sea. However this
may be, there are, nevertheless, other people who presume,
that if the Count de Rochambeau does not go directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to Canada, he may very well go and disembark at
Rhode Island, where he may make a place of arms, in
order to go from thence, and join himself to General
Washington, and attack New York together, while it is
unfurnished with a strong garrison."</p>

<p>In this manner it is, that some person or other is employed
to give scope to the speculations and conjectures of
the public, while the Courts of Europe flatter themselves,
that their real Councils are kept secret. There is reason,
however, to believe that, in fact, the Councils of all the
Courts of Europe are penetrated by their enemies. The
Councils of Congress, in many striking and important instances,
although necessarily confided to such numbers,
have been much more inviolably kept, without the aid of
hired paragraph writers to disguise them. Our character
and interest depend upon improving this fidelity, as well as
upon discountenancing both by manners and authority, that
base art so prevalent in Europe, that of political lying.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 2d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>When a Minister of an ancient nation, which has been
renowned for its wisdom and virtue, as well as power, rises
in a popular assembly, which is the most conspicuous
theatre in Europe, and declares, as it were, in the face of
all the world, and with an air of reflection, of deliberation,
and of solemnity, that such and such are his own opinions,
concerning the truth of facts, and the probability of future
events, one cannot call in question his good faith, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
we may know his information to be false, and his judgment
erroneous.</p>

<p>Lord George Germain, in the debate in the House of
Commons, on the 6th of May, declared, that "he flattered
himself the completion of the chief wish of his heart,
peace with America, on what he thought good and honorable
terms for Great Britain, was not far off. He verily
believed, and his belief was not merely speculative, but
founded on recent information, that the moment of conciliation
was near. His Lordship described the misery,
which the Americans felt at this time, and stated, that the
greatest majority of the people there were ready and desirous
to return to their allegiance, but that they were prevented
by the tyranny of those, who had got the power
of government into their own hands. He did not believe
the Congress would ever treat for peace, but from
the condition of affairs in America, from the depreciation
of their paper currency, from the poverty and distress
of the country, from the great debt it groaned under,
from the dissatisfaction, which all ranks of people expressed
at the alliance with France, from the little benefit
America had derived from that alliance; from all these
considerations he did believe, that the people of America
and the Assemblies of America would soon come to
terms."</p>

<p>There may be some ambiguity in the phrase, "good and
honorable terms for Great Britain;" but there can be no
reasonable doubt, that his Lordship meant either to return
to their allegiance to Great Britain, or at least to make a
peace with her, separate from France. Whether the Americans
ever will agree to such terms or not, being a question
concerning a future event, cannot be decided by witnesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
nor any other way, but by probable arguments.
There is one argument, which his Lordship does not appear
to have considered. It is of some weight. It is
this, that in order to return to their allegiance to the King
of England, or make a peace with him, separate from
France, they must involve themselves in a certain war
with France and Spain, at least, and indeed, according to
present appearances, with Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Holland,
and Portugal, for every one of these powers appear
to be as decided against the claims, pretensions, and usurpations
of Great Britain upon the seas, as France and Spain
are. There is not an American merchant, yeoman, tradesman,
or seaman, but knows this, or will know it very soon.
Americans must therefore be destitute of that common
share of reason, which God has given to men, to exchange
the friendship of all the nations of the world for their
enmity, merely for the sake of returning to a connexion
with Great Britain, which could not protect them, and
which they have the best reasons to dread as the greatest
evil that could befal them, from the unheard of tyrannies
and cruelties they have already experienced from her.
His Lordship is desired to consider this, and to ask himself
if he was an American, whether he would wish to run
under the broken fragments of an empire, that is dashed
in pieces, like a china vase, and commence a fresh war
against a combination of all the nations of the world, who
discover a degree of esteem and regard for America.</p>

<p>If the Americans are as miserable as his Lordship
represents them, will they be likely to increase that misery
tenfold, and make it perpetual, by exposing the cause of
a ruined empire, and going to war with half a dozen that
are not ruined?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>If we believe the testimonies of witnesses, who come
from all parts of America, we shall be convinced, that his
Lordship deceives himself. Every man from that country,
who knows the principles and opinions of the people, declares,
that they are, with an unanimity, that is unexampled
in any other revolution, firmly determined to maintain their
sovereignty and their alliances, and that there is nobody
there who utters a wish of returning to the government of
Great Britain, or even of making a separate peace.</p>

<p>But if his Lordship was a candid inquirer after truth,
and had a mind sufficiently enlightened to discover the
means, that are in the power of all men, of obtaining it, he
might have seen his error. There are certain marks, by
which the opinions, principles, inclinations, and wishes of
a people, may be discovered with infallible certainty,
without recurring to witnesses, or to far fetched arguments.</p>

<p>The press, the towns, the juries, and the Assemblies,
are four sources, from whence an unerring demonstration
of the true sentiments of the people of America may be
drawn. There is not in any nation of the world so unlimited
a freedom of the press as is now established in every
State of America, both by law and practice. Every man
in Europe, who reads their newspapers, must see it.
There is nothing that the people dislike, that they do not
attack. They attack officers of every rank in the militia,
and in the army; they attack judges, governors, and magistrates,
of every denomination. They attack Assemblies,
and Councils, members of Congress, and Congress itself,
whenever they dislike their conduct. But I appeal to
every newspaper upon the Continent, whether one paragraph,
one wish, or hint of returning to the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of Great Britain, or of making a separate peace, has ever
appeared.</p>

<p>The towns in many parts of America are small districts
of territory, on an average perhaps six miles square. By
the ancient laws of the country, which are still in force,
any seven inhabitants of one of these towns have a right
to demand of the magistrates a public assembly of all.
There are necessarily several of these town meetings
every year, and generally a great number of them. In
these assemblies, every man, high and low, every yeoman,
tradesman, and even day laborer, as well as every gentleman
and public magistrate, has a right to vote, and to
speak his sentiments upon public affairs, to propose measures,
to instruct their representatives in the Legislature,
&amp;c. This right was constantly and frequently used under
the former government, and is now much more frequently
used under the new. The world has seen some hundreds
of sets of instructions to representatives under the former
government, wherein they enjoined an open opposition to
judges, governors, acts of Parliament, King, Lords, and
Commons of Great Britain. What is there now to prevent
them from opposing Congress? Nothing. Has a single
vote of any one of these towns been read, or one speech
heard, proposing, or uttering a wish to return to the government
of Great Britain? Not one. Is not this a demonstration
of the sentiments of the people?</p>

<p>Juries in America were formerly another organ, by
which the sentiments of the people were conveyed to the
public. Both Grand Juries and Petit Juries, have expressed
themselves in language sufficiently bold and free,
against acts of Parliament, and the conduct of Great Britain.
But has any one ever uttered a word against Congress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
or the Assemblies, or the judges, under their new
governments? or a wish to return to the obedience of
England? Not one. But it is said, the paper money
embarrasses Congress. What then? Does this tend to
make them dissolve their union? To violate their alliances?
Would the paper money embarrass Congress less
if they had a war to maintain against France and Spain,
than it does now? Would not the embarrassment be much
greater? Does the paper money prevent the increase and
the population of the States? No. Does the war prevent
it? No. Both the population and the property of the
States have increased every year, since this war began.
And all the efforts of Great Britain cannot prevent it. On
the contrary, has the wealth and population of Great Britain
increased? Has her commerce increased? Has the
political weight of the nation in the scales of Europe increased?
Let a melancholy Briton tell.</p>

<p>His Lordship talks about the misery of the people in
America. Let him look at home, and then say, where is
misery! where the hideous prospect of an internal civil war
is added to a war with all the world. The truth is, that agriculture
and manufactures, not of luxuries, but of necessaries,
have been so much increased by this war, that it is
much to be doubted, whether they ever fed or clothed themselves
more easily or more comfortably. But, besides this,
the immense depredations they have made upon the British
trade, have introduced vast quantities of British merchandises
of every sort. And in spite of all the exertions of
the British fleet, their trade is opening and extending with
various countries every year, and Britain herself is forced
to aid it, and will be more and more; a recent proof of
which, is the permission to import American tobacco into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the kingdom from any part of the world in neutral bottoms.</p>

<p>The great debt is also mentioned. Do they pay an
interest for this debt? Is every necessary and convenience
of life taxed to perpetuity, to pay this interest? Is the
whole equal in proportion to their abilities to the debt of
England? Would the debt be rendered less, by joining
Great Britain against France and Spain? Would the war
against France and Spain be shorter, less expensive, or
less bloody, than the war against England? By returning
to England, would not their debt be ten times more burdensome?
This debt is as nothing to America, once give
her peace, let the Americans trade freely with one another,
and with all other nations, and this debt would be but a
feather. Let them come under Great Britain again, and
have the communication between one Colony and another
obstructed, as heretofore, and their trade confined to Great
Britain, as heretofore, and this debt would be a heavier millstone
about their necks, than that of England is about theirs.</p>

<p>A general repugnance to the alliance with France, is
mentioned. A greater mistake was never made. On the
contrary, every step of Congress, every proceeding of
every Assembly upon the continent, every prayer that is
made in the pulpit, and every speculation in the newspapers,
demonstrates the high sense they have of the importance
of this alliance. It is said, that this alliance has
been of little utility. Has it not employed the British
army? has it not cut out work enough for the British
navy? has it not wasted for England her annual twenty
millions? has it not prevented these from being employed
against America? has it not given scope to American privateers?
has it not protected the American trade? has it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
not hurt that of Great Britain? has it not engaged Russia,
Holland, Sweden, Denmark, and Portugal, at least to a
neutrality? at least has it not contributed much to these
vast advantages to America? has it not taken away from
Great Britain the dominion of the sea, so far as to allow
liberty of navigation to others? It is true, the alliance
might have been of more utility to all the allies with the
same expense, if France and Spain had sooner adopted
the policy of sending more of their forces to America.
But they are now so well convinced of it, that unless miracles
are wrought to prevent it, America and England too
will soon see more of the effects of this alliance. Let
Britain tremble at the consequences of her own folly and
her own crime.</p>

<p>His Lordship says, that the people would return to their
allegiance, if they were not restrained by the tyranny of
those who have got the powers of government. These are
the Assemblies, Senates, Governors, and Congress. Now
what power have any of these, but what the people please to
allow them? By what engine is this tyranny exercised? Is
it by the militia? In order to judge of this, let us consider
the constitution of the militia. The militia, is in fact the
whole people, for by the laws of every State, every man
from sixteen to sixty years of age, belongs to the militia, is
obliged to be armed, to train and march upon occasion, or
find a substitute. The officers are chosen by the men, except
the General officers, who are appointed by the Assemblies.
It is this very militia which forms the body of voters,
who annually choose the members of the Assembly, and the
senators, and governors. Is it possible these men should
tyrannise over men upon whom they are so entirely dependent?
As well might it be reproached to his Lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and his colleagues in administration, that they tyrannised
over their royal master, who can displace them at his
pleasure. The Assemblies thus annually chosen by the
people, or militia, annually choose the delegates in Congress,
and have power to recall them at pleasure. Will
the militia then obey either Assemblies or Congress in the
execution of tyrannical orders, or any orders that are not
generally agreeable to them? The thing speaks for itself.
Is it the Continental army then, that is the instrument
of their own servitude and that of their country? Every
officer holds his commission at the pleasure of Congress.
But his Lordship and his colleagues often represent the
Continental army as so small and feeble, as to be unable
to make head against the British troops, and it is true that
they are constantly employed in that service, and it is true
that they are nothing in comparison with the militia. What
would become of them then, if the militia or any considerable
number of them were to join the British troops?</p>

<p>There has never been any part of the Continental army
in more than three or four of the thirteen States at a time,
watching the motions of the British army and confining
them to the protection of their men-of-war. What has
there been then in the remaining nine or ten States for an
instrument of tyranny? This is too ridiculous to need
many words.</p>

<p>His Lordship concludes, with a distinction, if possible,
less grounded than his assertions. He says, that Congress
will never treat, but that the people and the Assemblies
will. Where does his Lordship find the ground of his
difference between the Congress and the Assemblies? Are
not the members of Congress made of the same clay? Are
they not themselves members of the Assemblies? Are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
they not the creatures of the Assemblies? Are they not
annually created? Are they not dependent every moment
upon the Assemblies for their existence? Have not the
Assemblies a right to recall them when they please, and
appoint others by law and the constitution? Have not the
Assemblies a right to instruct them how to act? If they do
not obey these instructions, cannot the Assemblies displace
them and appoint others who will be more obedient? If
the Assemblies desired a reconciliation with England,
would not they appoint a Congress who desired it too?
If the people desired it, could not they appoint Assemblies
who would soon make a Congress suitable for their purpose?
But I have been too long; his Lordship betrays
such misinformation of facts, such an inattention to those
obvious marks of the feelings of a people, as are infallible
indications of their designs, and such a want of knowledge
of the laws and constitution of the United States, as excite
astonishment in an impartial examiner, and a real commiseration
for the unhappy nation, who are devoted to destruction
from his errors and delusions.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 4th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>We learn from the Hague, the 30th of May, that their
Noble and Grand Mightinesses have resolved since the offer
of the Commerce, to take for the equipment of the vessels
of war put into commission a certain portion of the crews
of merchant ships.</p>

<p>As I wish to inform Congress at some time or other of
all the conspicuous characters in Europe, who have penetrated
enough of the system of events, that compose the
present great epoch, and have had sufficient firmness to
resist the unnatural efforts and solicitations, which Great
Britain has made to disturb it, I think it is proper to take
notice, that the Count de Panin, who has been very ill of
a chronical disorder, was on the 2d of May much better,
and made his appearance at the Court of St Petersburg.
This Minister, I fancy, will have great merit with posterity,
for the part he has acted for several years in the politics
of Europe.</p>

<p>Extract of a letter from Cadiz, 2d of May. "The convoy
under the escort of Messrs de Thomasco and de Solano,
continued in sight all day, the 28th of April; the
29th it went off with a fair wind, which continues to this
time. We expect the division of Toulon in fifteen days.
Then Don Gaston will go out with a squadron of twelve
ships, and all the French vessels, which may be collected
in Cadiz. If the thirteen vessels, which are ready at Ferrol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
join this commander, his fleet will be very respectable,
and will not fear that the enemy should oppose his junction
with that of Brest."</p>

<p><em>Toulon, 10th of May.</em> "The order, which the King's
ships, the Zélé and the Marseillois, of seventyfour guns,
have received unexpectedly to sail, gives place to several
conjectures. The most probable is, that they are to join
the division of French vessels, which are in the bay of
Cadiz; and that after they shall be united, they will go in
concert with a Spanish squadron to Brest, to form a part
of the fleet destined to cruise in the English Channel.
There have been taken up in our port, several merchant
vessels on account of the King, to the end to go and carry
to Cadiz the provisions of the French division, commanded
by the Chevalier Beausset. It is confirmed, that the Experiment,
commanded by M. de Martelly Chautard, is
arrived at Marseilles, to escort from thence in concert with
the frigate the Graciente, and the cutter the Naiade, a
considerable convoy of vessels, bound for the islands in
America."</p>

<p><em>Brest, 15th of May.</em> "The convoy, which was coming
here from Bordeaux, to form the second division of the
expedition under the command of Messrs de Ternay and
de Rochambeau, escaped the gale of wind by taking shelter
in L'Orient. The Magnanime, which was coming
here from Rochfort, having lost an anchor, was obliged to
return thither."</p>

<p><em>Paris, 25th of May.</em> "Letters from Cadiz, dated the
5th of this month, announce the departure of the French
squadron, which was in the Road, under the command of
M. de Beausset. It was furnished with provisions for six
months, and before it put to sea it took in more, for six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
weeks; it was to have sailed the 6th. We are absolutely
ignorant of the object of his expedition. M. Beausset has
despatches, which he is not to open until he arrives at a
certain latitude. This squadron, composed of five ships of
the line, and loaded with provisions for seven and a half
months, is it bound to the Indies? We do not believe that
it is. But to combine with M. de Ternay at a certain
latitude? Some persons presume so. Others maintain,
that this squadron is to make part of the fleet of observation
in the Channel, and that the circumstance of seven
and a half months' provision is a falsity, which ought not
to be believed."</p>

<p>They write from Rochfort, that the Invincible, a new
ship, of one hundred and four guns, is actually in the
Road. The command of this vessel has been given to M.
de la Cary. The following article shows, that some foreign
merchants are enterprising a trade towards America.</p>

<p><em>Ostend, 23d of May.</em> "The ship, the City of Brussels,
Captain Peter Voughen, of five hundred tons, belonging
to merchants of Brussels, who had loaded her for
St Eustatia, has had the misfortune to strike, the 20th of
this month, in going out of the basin. In spite of the alacrity
with which they labor to get her afloat, and repair the
damage she has sustained on the occasion, we think she
cannot again be put in a condition to proceed to her destination."</p>

<p><em>Leyden, 30th of May, 1780.</em> "The convoy of troops,
which has arrived so apropos, at Barbadoes, and from
thence to St Lucia, at the very instant that the Count de
Guichen conducted to the Antilles a considerable reinforcement
for the French troops, is that which sailed from
Portsmouth the 27th, and from Plymouth the 30th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
January, under convoy of the Intrepid, of sixtyfour guns,
with some frigates, and which was dispersed upon the coast
of Ireland. An officer of the sixtyeighth regiment, (one of
the four regiments embarked upon this convoy,) writes
from Antigua, the 19th of March. 'We have been arrived
here two days; we sailed from Plymouth the 30th of
January, in concert with the eightyseventh, ninetieth, and
ninetyfirst regiments, under convoy of the Intrepid, of sixtyfour
guns. The next day we were separated from the
convoy by a great storm, which lasted six days, and we
saw nothing more of any vessel. Having no orders concerning
our destination, as we were not to receive them
till we had doubled Cape Lizard, we were in great pain
concerning the part we should take. Commanding eighty
soldiers on board this vessel, it fell to me to direct their
route. I ordered the master to conduct us to the first of
our West India Islands, which we could gain, and in consequence
we arrived here safe and sound. God knows
what is become of the rest of the convoy; I hope that it
will join us soon.'"</p>

<p>The following article I add, from the Mercury of France,
of the 3d of June. I cannot answer for the truth of it, nor
do I know that it is false.</p>

<p>"They write from London the 11th of May, that a
courier despatched from the Hague, by Sir Joseph Yorke,
had arrived with the following news. In consequence of
the permission granted by the States-General for the passage
of the recruits from Brunswick, Hesse, Hanau, &amp;c.
in the pay of Great Britain, through the territory of the
Republic, and for their embarkation in one of their ports,
one ship of war and transports have sailed from England,
to take on board these recruits destined for the army in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Canada. But scarcely were the troops and their baggage
embarked, when there arrived an order of the States-General
to stop their departure. They attribute this conduct
of the States-General to the formal demand, which they
have made upon Great Britain, of the restitution of the
Dutch vessels taken by Commodore Fielding. In consequence,
the transports and recruits would remain in Holland,
until entire satisfaction should be given to the States-General
upon this object."</p>

<p><em>Brussels, 30th of May.</em> "The arrival of extraordinary
couriers continually from Versailles and Madrid to Lisbon,
gives rise to conjectures, that the good intelligence,
which reigns between this Court and that of London, may
very well change in part, and that at least his Most Faithful
Majesty is not far from adopting the system of Holland and
the Northern powers, the effect of which must be the
maintenance of the liberty of the navigation and of the
commerce of their respective subjects, against the continual
depredations of privateers."</p>

<p><em>Paris, 30th of May.</em> "We learn by letters from Ferrol,
that the Intendant of the Marine in that port had received
orders to send out without delay, eight ships of the line
and four frigates, and to deliver them packets, which are
sent him, not to be opened but in a certain latitude. They
write from Brest, that they continue to work at the armament
of the vessels intended for the fleet; there are several
of them already in the Road. The Actif of seventyfour
guns came in on the 17th. They expected in that
port the fleet from Bordeaux, loaded with stores, provisions,
and wine. Their arrival is necessary to equip completely
the squadron destined to transport a second division
of troops of four or five thousand men. The convoy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
which sailed from St Malo on Good Friday, was still at
Cherbourg. It is so much the more valuable, as it consists
partly of cast cannons, and other pieces of artillery,
brought in wagons from the arsenals, for the descent which
was to have been made last year. The English who know
its value, do not lose sight of it, as they say. And it is
said, if they were not restrained by a calculation of the
expense, they would bombard Cherbourg, if they could
not come at the vessels in port to burn them. It is believed
that a few ships of the line may soon go out of
Brest, to give chase to the English and scatter them from
Cherbourg.</p>

<p><em>London, 20th of May.</em> "The despatches, which the
Court has received from its Ministers in the Northern
Courts, confirm the plan of confederation of the powers of
this part of Europe to protect the commerce of their subjects
against the attacks of the belligerent powers, and we cannot
dissemble that more moderation on our part would
have hindered this event, which is about to strike the last
blow to our maritime supremacy, and snatch from us forever
the empire of the seas, which are about to become
again free as they ought to be."</p>

<p><em>Cadiz, 5th of May.</em> "The fleet which sailed from this
port the 28th of last month, has been met in the latitude of
Lagos, by a vessel which arrived yesterday. Since that
time, the progress of it has not been retarded. The wind
is changed, and is favorable. It is composed of twelve
ships of the line, five frigates, seven privateers armed by
the trade, sixtyfour transport vessels, with twelve thousand
land forces, artillery, and warlike stores, and fiftynine merchant
vessels, three of which are French and three American.
There remain in this port fifteen ships of the line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
whereof ten are ready to go to sea, the five others will be
immediately. There are eight at Corunna, five frigates
and one cutter, in condition to sail at the first orders.
The convoy which sailed from Brest on the 14th is arrived
there with the frigate, the Leocadia. We have seen
come to anchor in this bay, the flag of truce, the Sartine,
which brings from the Indies M. de Bellecombe, formerly
governor of Pondicherry, and the other officers. This
vessel being off St Vincent, had the misfortune to meet the
squadron of Commodore Johnstone. He made the signals
of a flag of truce, and seeking to fly, when in contempt
of the law of nations, Commodore Johnstone who was in
the Romney, sent him two broadsides, which killed and
wounded twentyfive persons on board the Sartine. The
Captain and two officers are in the number of the slain.
They expected so little such an attack, that the people
were all upon the tillace, and one bullet fell dead at the
feet of M. de Bellecombe. Johnstone, knowing his error,
or at least pretending to have been mistaken, ceased firing,
and wrote a letter of excuse. One would think he should
not come off so easily, and that his nation should not even
content herself to disavow his conduct.</p>

<p>"M. de Beausset set sail yesterday with his five vessels;
he goes to cruise in the latitude of Lisbon, and he
may very well combine himself with the seven vessels,
which were to go out of Ferrol. It is believed he will
return here as soon as the squadron of Toulon shall arrive."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 5th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The fleets of Graves and Walsingham are real objects
of humor. All Europe was amused with Walsingham's
squadron, and assured that it was to sail as long ago as last
January or February. There has scarcely a newspaper
appeared in Europe since that time but has had some article
respecting it, all tending to show that it was ready, or
nearly ready, to sail. This is in order to keep up the
spirits of friends, and at the same time play upon the
fears of enemies. The last Courier de l'Europe has the
following article.</p>

<p><em>Torbay, 20th of May.</em> "Although the wind had been
favorable for ten days past, Walsingham's fleet could not
have taken advantage of them, the Commodore having received,
on the 10th, orders from the Admiralty to wait for
the rest of the transports bound to Quebec, and the East
India ships, which now lie at Portsmouth. He will escort
them without altering his course as far as Madeira."</p>

<p><em>Plymouth, 9th of May.</em> "The squadron of Admiral
Graves, sailed from hence this morning, is destined for Jamaica.
It consists of four ships of the line, two frigates,
and transports, having on board three thousand land forces.
This fleet is the reinforcement which the armament, which
was in preparation at Jamaica for an expedition, waited for
the sixth of April last, when the packet boat sailed. The
passage of such a fleet cannot take less than two months;
so that it cannot arrive at Jamaica until the end of July.
Never was there such confusion and timidity, and irresolution
and unsteadiness in the naval and maritime affairs of
England. Witness the following paragraph."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><em>Portsmouth, 22d of May.</em> "The following vessels of
war had come to sail with their respective convoys, but
they have returned here again. The Endymion, of fortyfour
guns, Captain Cartaret; the Beaver's prize of sixteen,
Captain Drummond, and the Zephyr, of fourteen, Captain
Inglis, for the coast of Guinea. The frigate Aurora for
Plymouth, the sloops Swallow and Wasp.</p>

<p><em>May 25th.</em> "It is said, the regiment of Colonel Rainsford
passed through London to go to Portsmouth, destined
to Jamaica. It will be escorted out of the Channel
by the Grand Fleet, then it will make a common course
up to a certain latitude, with the fleet destined for the East
Indies."</p>

<p><em>Petersburg, 9th of May.</em> "Our fleet, destined to maintain
the neutrality at sea, is ready to sail from Cronstadt.
They say, that after having passed the Sound, it will clear
off all cruisers whatsoever, not only in the Baltic Sea, but
those which are in the neighborhood of Norway, as far as
Archangel. The report prevails, even that we shall equip
immediately a second squadron, destined to reinforce the
first."</p>

<p><em>Hague, 31st of May.</em> "The corn merchants living in
Amsterdam, presented last Friday two petitions, the first
of which is of the following tenor.</p>

<p>"To their High Mightinesses, our Lords the States-General
of the United Provinces.</p>

<p>"The subscribing merchants, trading chiefly in grain, at
the Exchange of the Corn Merchants of the city of Amsterdam,
respectfully make known, that the scarcity of grain
among foreigners having been the cause that they have
been charged, for sometime, and from all parts with very
considerable commissions for sending off theirs, which cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but give a new activity to this important branch of commerce;
the difficulties, which in the present situation of
affairs embarrass navigation, have raised the price of freight
to such a degree, that several masters of ships have entirely
refused to navigate towards the south, considering that
they could not expose themselves to execute the commissions
of the said merchants in grain, without running the
risk of being seized and taken, which became extremely
prejudicial to the corn, which is liable to take hurt and to
corrupt; from whence it must necessarily result, that for
want of sales the petitioners see themselves on one hand
deprived of a reasonable profit, and on the other find
themselves forced to keep their grain in their magazines
for a longer space of time, while, moreover, the importation
by the Baltic, which diminishes by this means considerably,
cannot fail also to give to this branch of commerce, so
interesting for the Republic, a most sensible blow, to the
great prejudice of the petitioners, as well as to the agriculture
of these provinces, the advantage of which increases
in proportion to the augmentation of the export of corn.</p>

<p>"For these causes, the petitioners address themselves in
all humanity to your High Mightinesses, respectfully praying,
that according to your known wisdom and foresight, it
may please your High Mightinesses to grant them a remedy,
and grant them a protection as prompt as convenient
to commerce and to the navigation of the petitioners, to
the end, that their vessels loaded with corn may, without
any impediment, make sail toward all places that are free.
The petitioners, on their part, will be zealous to second
vigorously all the measures, which in this respect your
High Mightinesses may judge convenient and necessary."</p>

<p>The second of the petitions contains as follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>"To their Noble and Grand Mightinesses, our Lords, the
States of the Province of Holland and of West Friesland,</p>

<p>"The undersigned, merchants dealing chiefly in grain,
at the exchange of the corn merchants of the city of Amsterdam,
give respectfully to understand, that to the end to
preserve and maintain this branch of commerce so important
for them, they had found it of the last necessity to
address themselves by the way of a petition, to their High
Mightinesses the States-General of the United Provinces,
tending to request a prompt, convenient, and sufficient
protection in favor of their navigation, for the reasons more
fully particularised in the said petition, of which they take
the liberty to annex a copy; humbly requesting your Noble
and Grand Mightinesses to cast a propitious eye upon
the address of the petitioners, and to be so good as to favor
it with your powerful protection, that they may be at length
remedied against the unjust vexations, and the ruinous
seizure of their ships, and against all the shackles, which
have been put upon their commerce, while the petitioners
on their part offer to concur with all their hearts, and with
zeal, in all convenient measures, which, in this respect
your Noble and Grand Mightinesses shall judge to be
necessary, to come at the end proposed."</p>

<p><em>Hamburg, 26th of May.</em> "They write from Stockholm,
that the Court of Sweden had positively accepted
the plan of an armed neutrality, proposed by Russia, and
given orders to equip six more ships of the line, so that at
present the naval forces of Sweden, like those of Denmark,
consist in ten ships of the line and six frigates,
whereof six ships of the line are ready to make sail from
the port of Carslscroon.</p>

<p>"We learn from the Sound, that the 21st of this month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the English ship the Chatham, of fifty guns, commanded by
Captain G. Altan, was arrived there, as well as the frigates
the Siren, the Lizard, and the Lynx, under the command
of the Captains Dodde, Parry, and Britton, of twentyfour
and twenty guns. The cutters, the Bussy, Captain
Coaths, of twelve guns, and the Frederick, C. Pasechall,
of eight. These two last have sustained in the North Sea
a brisk action with two French cutters, one of which was
named the Alexander, of fourteen guns, which they have
conducted to the Sound. It is not known what is become
of the other prize, which they think is sunk, or carried to
Norway."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 10th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>We read, under the head of Hamburg, of the 20th of
May, that the project of a confederation, armed for the
maintenance of the navigation of the neutral powers, appears
every day to assume more consistency. The fleet
armed in Russia for the protection of her neutrality, and of
her commerce, is composed of fifteen ships of the line,
four frigates, and a large number of smaller vessels. Their
orders are to sweep, not only the Baltic Sea, but the Swedish
Sea, and the neighborhood of Archangel, of all the
corsairs of the belligerent powers. They assure us at the
same time, that orders are given to equip at Revel and at
Archangel a second fleet of twenty ships of the line;
Sweden arms ten, and six frigates. She will send out at
first but four of the former, the six others will remain at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Carslscroon, but in a condition to sail at the first signal.
They are busy in Denmark in arming a like number.
They assure us even that there are orders to augment it.</p>

<p>The opinion the most general is, that the powers, which
are to enter into the armed neutrality, will confine themselves
at first to make their navigation to be respected, and
will not appear as mediators, but when they shall see that
the fate of arms shall make the balance incline too much
to one side, to the disadvantage of the other. It will be
then, that they will intervene for a re-establishment of the
equilibrium, by moderating the too excessive pretensions
of some, and by repairing the losses, which the misfortune,
the negligence, or the unskilfulness of others shall have
occasioned them. One does not know, which we ought
to admire most, the immutability of the English, in the
midst of all the movements, which they excite, or the
movements themselves, which they are no doubt themselves
astonished to have excited. This recalls the saying
of an Englishman, who seeing a magnificent chapel built
for the accomplishment of a vow, made in the midst of a
battle, cried, "When the Emperor made this great vow, he
had great fear." Is it not astonishing, that the most formidable
maritime powers of Europe should have believed
their rights so much in danger, as to make it their duty to
confederate against the arbitrary pretensions of England?
It would be much more astonishing, if she should be able
to realise them, but this is not to be presumed.</p>

<p>Under the head of Italy, Genoa, the 10th of May, we
read, "They write from Trieste, that they are actively employed
there in arming a company of commerce for the
East Indies. The grant (charter, patent, octroi) is very
soon to appear in print, that every one may have shares in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
it, and have a part in the advantages that shall result from
it. As it is of importance to our Court, that the productions
of the country should be transported to foreigners,
this company will obtain all the privileges necessary to put
it upon a flourishing footing. They are taking all possible
measures, that the funds advanced should produce to the
proprietors a considerable interest. Austria proposes to
observe the most exact neutrality with all the maritime
powers, and to form alliances with the States of Barbary.
In the meantime, that we may have nothing to fear from
these last, our vessels will be partly armed for war, and
partly loaded with merchandises."</p>

<p>A sensible letter from London (real or fictitious I know
not) says, "The armed neutrality engages still the attention
of our Court. We do not cease to dread here, that it
will have melancholy consequences. If some persons
flatter themselves, that it may lead to peace, others think
that we cannot make an advantageous one. France and
Spain appear determined not to lay down their arms until
they shall have taken away from us the empire of the seas,
and rendered commerce and navigation free. We are not
ignorant, that the wish of Europe is in their favor, and
the armed neutrality has sufficiently demonstrated it. Our
Ministry well convinced, that it is upon a superiority at sea,
that depends the safety of our possessions in the four quarters
of the world, will neglect nothing to preserve it. But
it is at least necessary, that by a prudent conduct towards
the neutral powers, we should engage them to permit us to
enjoy it. The part which we act cannot but alienate them.
Far from retracting, we go directly on."</p>

<p>According to the account of the officers arrived in the
cartel ship, the Sartine, the squadron of Admiral Hughes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in its passage from Europe to the Cape of Good Hope, has
suffered considerable losses, which have very much diminished
it. They are persuaded, that it has not suffered less
in its route to the Indies, during which it has had constantly
contrary winds, and that it has been scarcely able
to land in Asia a number of troops sufficient to put the
English forces there in the condition they were in before
the war. Admiral Hughes had said to the Governor of
the Cape, that his orders were to go and attack Manilla.
But it is most probable, that at his arrival at Madras, he
found himself in an impossibility of undertaking anything
this year. He has not a sufficient number of troops with
him, and far from being able to take any in India, those
already there are sufficiently occupied with the chiefs of
the country, and have occasion for reinforcements. Nadgiskan,
General of the Emperor of Mogul, threatens them
in Bengal. The Marattas disturb them at Bombay; and
Hyder Aly Khan upon the coast of Coromandel. The
English, troubled in their own possessions, have more cause
to think of preserving them than of attempting elsewhere
expeditions, that would weaken them.</p>

<p>The last letters from the gold coast of Africa contain the
following details. "One of our out-forts, called Succondée,
has been attacked sometime since by a French frigate,
of forty guns. She cast anchor in the Bay within
cannon-shot of the fort, which was falling in ruins, defended
solely by some pieces of artillery, almost out of a
condition for service, and in which was a garrison of four
men, to wit; the commandant, one sergeant, and two soldiers,
which in such a situation could not make a long resistance.
Nevertheless, before they surrendered, they
killed six Frenchmen, and wounded twelve. The sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of the fort was killed; and the commandant, seeing
that the enemy had effected their landing with two hundred
men, saved himself by retreating back into the country.
The French have derived neither honor nor profit
from the expedition; they have found nothing but the
effects of the commandant, valued at eight hundred pounds
sterling, which they destroyed. The fort contained nothing
valuable. They spiked the cannon, which they found
upon carriages, and broke off the trunnions; after which
they went off without attempting anything against the other
forts. The same letters add, that the Governor of Cape
Coast Castle, and those of the other forts, were preparing
to quit a service, in which they could not long remain, the
company having stopped the arrearages which were due to
them, as well as to those in general who have been employed
since the month of December, 1778, and having
refused to reimburse them the sums, which they have
advanced out of their pockets for the maintenance of the
forts of the government, and which amount to half of their
private fortunes. By a conduct so unjust, and without
example, the principal officers find themselves ruined, and
the inferior officers and soldiers are dying with hunger.
There was scarcely an English vessel upon the coast, and
the price of all the necessaries of life were raised more
than an hundred per hundred. What defence could be
made by people in such a situation, if attacked by the
French, who burn with a desire of forming an establishment
upon that coast."</p>

<p>The losses in Africa are considerable, and the English
are threatened with more considerable in India, where the
natives of the country begin to be weary of the vexation of
foreigners, who come from Europe to subject them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
yoke. The Emperor of Mogul threatens them in Bengal,
the Marattas at Bombay, and the famous Hyder Aly upon
the coast of Coromandel, and the domestic troubles which
have arisen in the bosom of their establishments, may put
them out of a condition to defend them. All Europe
prays for the liberty of the seas, and waits with impatience
the effects of the union of the maritime powers, which must
put a bridle upon the violent and arbitrary proceedings of
the English.</p>

<p>On the 18th and 19th of May there were warm debates
in the House of Commons of Ireland, where the patriotic
party carried a duty of twelve shillings per quintal on sugars
imported from England. On the 22d, it was resolved
by an hundred and forty voices against eighteen, that a bill
should be brought in for the punishment of mutiny and
desertion, and to establish better regulations for the land
forces. This is a decisive measure, and if it is admitted,
it concedes the principle, that the British Parliament has no
authority over Ireland.</p>

<p><em>Hague, 4th of June.</em> "M. de Nowicoff, Secretary of
the Prince de Gallitzin, Envoy Extraordinary of the Empress
of Russia, being returned here the first of this month
at night, from Petersburg, where he has been as express
some weeks ago, the Prince de Gallitzin had the next day
a conference with some members of government. A second
express, sent to Petersburg by the same Minister
about the middle of April, returned last night. We flatter
ourselves, that the despatches which they bring will contribute
to accelerate the execution of the project of an
armed neutrality, for which her Imperial Majesty continues
to testify the most favorable dispositions, provided that the
other neutral powers act readily in concert with her. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
merchants of Dort and Rotterdam have followed the example
of those of Amsterdam, by presenting on the 2d
a petition to the States-General, to the end to supplicate
them to hasten the equipment of the vessels, which it has
been resolved to arm, and to give to commerce the effectual
enjoyment of the protection of the State. According
to the ordinance projected to accelerate this equipment,
'no merchant vessel belonging to the subjects of the Republic
can put to sea, without voluntarily delivering to the
college of the Admiralty at least the third man of her crew,
under penalty of six hundred florins per head, upon the
captains and freighters of the vessel, which shall attempt to
go out without having made the said delivery.' It will not,
however, take place but twice a year, viz. the two first
voyages which a vessel shall make, and from this will be
excepted those upon which there shall be but two men
besides the master, the vessels employed in the different
fisheries, the ships of the East India Company, and those
of the West Indies; in fine, the foreign vessels manned
with crews of their own nation, &amp;c."</p>

<p><em>April 21st, 1780.</em> "It happened that the French privateer,
the Spring, commanded by Captain John Huë,
and mounted with four guns, which had anchored in the
Road of Helvoetsluys, put to sea in company with some
Dutch vessels, bound to the Greenland Fishery. Three
Scotch coal vessels put to sea at the same time, and soon
after two others, somewhat larger. The three largest having
come just opposite the point of Westland, the French
privateer, which was not at the distance of more than four
yards from the shore, opposite the Cape of the Isle of
Goree, wore round to return into port; the three coal vessels
perceiving it, made the same man&oelig;uvre, and bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
down upon the French privateer, upon which the latter
approaching nearer and nearer the coast, and passing along
very near it under the city of Goree, to enter into the port,
they began to fire upon him with ball, and they continued
to cannonade him incessantly, although this little vessel,
which in truth carried French colors, did not answer them
with more than one gun. They pursued him quite up to
the lighthouse of Goree, only at the distance of about six
yards (I suppose ship's yards) west of the place, where
they forced her to run ashore. The vessel was there
stopped upon the sand, and the crew crawling along upon
the bowsprit in the sea, saved themselves at land. Meantime,
the three coalmen did not cease to fire upon the little
privateer, without regarding even a large number of workmen
who were about their business on shore. So that the
bullets passed through the midst of these people, and just
over their heads, and they were very happy to run off and
save themselves in the Downs. The three coalmen, not
content to have pushed thus far their enterprise, continued
not only to fire upon the privateer stopped in the sand,
without any crew, but in fine, they came to anchor at the
distance of about forty yards from this vessel, while the two
smaller coalmen were come out of the Bay of Helvoetsluys,
and were under sail near and round it, firing upon it until
noon, when the tide began to set afloat the privateer, which
had been stopped for two hours. Then the English went
on board with their boats, took down the French flag, took
the vessel off the shore, and attached her broadside and
broadside to the largest of the coalmen. They took away
from her many effects, under the eyes of the Dutch coasting
pilots, who having asked in English, what was their
design in regard to the privateer, and having cautioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
them to take care what they did, the captain of the
largest of the coalmen answered, "We will take her, we
are also privateers."</p>

<p>Their Noble and Grand Mightinesses, the States of Holland
and West Friesland, after having stated these circumstances
to the States-General, have adopted in their report;
"that they considered this excessive audacity of the English
or Scotch coalmen, as a manifest and voluntary violation
of the territory of the Republic, accompanied with circumstances
the most aggravated, as having been committed
in going out of a harbor of this country, and in a place where
it could not be doubtful that they were within reach of the
cannon of the shore, since their own balls reached the land,
without the least provocation from the French privateer,
which did not fire a single gun. So that this action of the
coalmen, has had no other cause than a premeditated hostility,
whilst there was not the least reason to fear that the
privateer, after having got to sea, would interrupt one of
them, considering that the attack was begun on their part,
in the very moment when the privateer had tacked about
to quit the open sea and return into port, besides, that he
was pursued for two hours after that he was indubitably
aground upon the shore, and that the enterprise was finished
by taking away the French privateer from the Dutch
shore, contrary to the exhortation and warnings of the
coasting pilots. That in the judgment of their Noble and
Grand Mightinesses, the States-General had not only a
right to complain of the insolence so excessive on the part
of the English or Scotch masters, which their High Mightinesses
admit into the ports of the Republic, but that they
cannot even suffer them without wounding the neutrality,
which they have embraced in the present troubles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
without prejudicing the dignity, the sovereignty, and the
independence of the State; and having been under obligation
effectually to have opposed and hindered them, even
by force, if they could have been informed in time of these
violences, they cannot excuse themselves from demanding,
in a manner the most serious, the vessel which was taken,
and from demanding of his Britannic Majesty, a suitable
satisfaction for this conduct of his subjects."</p>

<p>After this report, the States-General have resolved, the
13th of May, "that advice of these facts should be sent to
the Count de Welderen, Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary
of their High Mightinesses at the British Court,
by sending him copies of the depositions joined to the
letter of the Receiver-General of the Customs of their
Noble and Grand Mightinesses, in the country of Voorne,
dated the 4th day of May last, by which he has informed
of the facts the Lords, the Deputy Counsellors of Holland,
as the said depositions are annexed to the letter, which the
said counsellors have addressed to their Noble and Grand
Mightinesses the 5th of the same month, concerning this
affair; and at the same time, the Count de Welderen
should be instructed to give notice, in the manner that he
shall judge the most convenient and the most effectual,
of the said insolences committed by the masters of the
English or Scotch coal vessels, and to complain, in the
name of their High Mightinesses, of a violation so incontestible
of their territory and of the law of nations, by the
way of open force; that their High Mightinesses cannot
think, that his Britannic Majesty can or will suffer that his
subjects should allow themselves in such excesses; that in
consequence, the Count de Welderen should demand a
suitable satisfaction; that the masters of the coal vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
should undergo a correction, and that the French vessel
taken should be brought back to the place from whence
she has been taken, or at least, that she should be restored
to their High Mightinesses, to the end that they may dispose
of her in the manner they shall judge proper; and
that the damages caused to this vessel, directly upon the
territory of their High Mightinesses, where she ought to
have enjoyed the same safety as the coal vessels in the
Road of Helvoetsluys, and through all the extent of the territory
of their High Mightinesses, should be made good."</p>

<p>The English frigate, the Ambuscade, Captain Phipps,
has taken, on the 24th of April last, in the Bay of Biscay,
four Dutch ships, which have made some resistance, so that
there were some men killed and wounded on both sides.
One of the Dutch captains was killed. They were bound,
it is said, from Helvoetsluys to Spain. They have been
carried into Plymouth, where arrived at the same time a
Spanish frigate of thirty guns, taken, they say, by the
English frigate, the Medea, off the port of Brest, where
she was going with despatches from the Court of Madrid,
relative to the junction of the French and Spanish fleets.
This is not likely, since the despatches go by land from
Court to Court.</p>

<p>I shall finish this tedious letter, by enclosing a letter
from the Count d'Urre Molans, proposing to raise some
horse at the expense of himself and his officers. I promised
to enclose it to Congress, which was all I could do.
But I hope, before an answer can come, the American
States will have no more occasion for cavalry.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 12th, 1780.
</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I cannot omit to request the attention of Congress to a
debate in the House of Peers on the 1st of June, upon
Lord Shelburne's motion for a variety of State papers to
be laid before the House. I have had the honor to transmit
these papers to Congress before. His Lordship in his
speech upon this occasion has displayed more knowledge
of the affairs of Europe, than all the debates in the two
Houses, and all the newspapers and pamphlets have contained
for a long time. I will translate from a French
translation, not having the original before me, what he
says of Russia.</p>

<p>"With regard to the papers, which concern Russia, I see
in the first place, in the declaration made by that Court in
1779, that under pretence of some disorders committed in
the Baltic Sea by an American privateer, (Captain McNeal,
I suppose,) the Empress announces to Great Britain,
that she is about to form a league with the Kings of Sweden
and Denmark, for the protection of commerce in that
sea. This Princess must have known our Ministers perfectly
well, to hope that they would fall into the snare.
Yes, she knew that they would bite at the hook, when it
was covered with the bait of some appearance of hostility
against the Americans. While they were running after
the dainty worm, all Europe saw clearly that this exclusion
from the Baltic Sea was general for all armed vessels,
whether American or English; but Russia was too
wise to begin by speaking of English vessels. It is, nevertheless,
curious to consider the nature of the right alleged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
by the Courts of Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen,
to arrogate to themselves the dominion of the Baltic; a
dominion no mention of which is made in any treaty existing,
and of which no one ever heard any mention made.
They say to you, that God Almighty intended that these
three powers should govern exclusively over this vast sea.
The terms of the declaration say expressly, that nature has
given them this right; if this declaration is extraordinary,
and without example, the last declaration of the Empress
of Russia is much more astonishing. This Princess dares
to announce a maritime code, which will serve as a rule
for all Europe. I will acknowledge, that when this Imperial
decree for the first time fell into my hands, I was confounded;
I felt in a moment, that Russia, this Empire
coming out of the cradle, scarcely reckoned a few years
ago in the number of maritime powers, this Russia, which
the Ministers declared to us was our friend and our ally,
was disposed not only to refuse us assistance, but moreover
to contribute to the annihilation of the maritime power of
Great Britain. The Empress declares in this Manifesto,
that free ships render the effects free, that they have on
board; she does not confine herself to establish this principle
in favor of the vessels of her nation, she makes it
general, she invites all the States of Europe, whether
neutral or belligerent, to unite with her to maintain it, and
to set them an example she informs them, that to maintain
it effectually she equips a powerful squadron. What
has given occasion to this astonishing measure? The infraction
of treaties on the part of Great Britain. By the
treaties of 1673 and 1674, Holland had a right to carry
all, which was not expressly declared contraband; in spite
of the existence of these treaties, Commodore Fielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
received the extravagant orders to seize a Dutch convoy.
This act of madness alarmed Russia, who forthwith published
her Manifesto, which Holland, France, and Spain
have received, with all the marks of the most perfect satisfaction.
France has not failed to seize this opportunity to
press the completion of the maritime code announced by
the Empress, promising to adopt it, and to unite with her
to support it.</p>

<p>"Such is the situation in which we find ourselves; not a
single ally! there did remain to us one friend; Administration
has found the secret to break with him. Is it not
the most consummate madness not to have sought to insure
a single ally? Opportunities have presented themselves
more than once, more than twice, more than four times.
If at the end of the war Administration was weary of the
connexion with the King of Prussia; if they preferred the
friendship, or even the alliance of the House of Austria,
the opportunity of making sure of it presented itself a few
years ago. In 1773, the epocha of the troubles in Poland,
Great Britain would have made a friend of this House, by
interposing its authority; this measure would have been
agreeable to more than one power of Europe. If we had
preferred the alliance of the King of Prussia, an opportunity
has presented more recently of procuring it, that of
the death of the Elector of Bavaria; sometime before this
event, France foresaw it with terror. She perceived how
much it might turn to the advantage of Great Britain, and
how much the war, that it would infallibly occasion between
the Courts of Vienna and Berlin, would be contrary
to her interests. What parts have our Ministers acted in
this circumstance? They let it escape like the first; instead
of conciliating the friendship of Austria, or renewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
that of Prussia, they have discovered the secret of disgusting
these two powers, as well as nearly all those of Europe;
they have suffered that France should be the mediator
between them, and make their peace.</p>

<p>Their conduct in regard to the Court of Petersburg, has
been equally chargeable with negligence; they have let
slip one or two occasions of conciliating the friendship of
that Court. At the time of her rupture with the Porte,
what part have they acted? They did not enter into the
negotiation; but, which they will perhaps have cause to
repent, they sent vessels to the Russians to teach them
how they might obtain and preserve that domination of the
seas, to which they pretend at this day. Such are the
fruits of the prudence and wisdom of our Ministers. They
have lost America, the most beautiful half of the Empire,
and against the half that remains to us, they have excited
all the powers of Europe. I say decidedly, that they have
lost America, because, after what has passed in Holland
and in Russia, one must be very short sighted not to
see, that in fine, and at present, the independence of
America is consummated. The maritime code confirms
the rest. France and the other maritime powers, whose
interest it is, that America should never return to the
domination of England, will take care to comprehend her
in the code; but I forewarn the Administration, that this
code will soon be in force; that if they do not speedily
make arrangements with Holland, there will be soon held
at the Hague a Congress, to the effect to give the sanction
of maritime Europe to the law which establishes, that
free ships shall make free goods."</p>

<p>I cannot say that his Lordship is perfectly fair in this
speech, nor that he has been much wiser than the Minister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
The true cause why the Minister suffered France to make
the peace between Russia and the Turk, and between
Austria and Prussia, was the American war. While they
pursued that phantom, all their men, all their ships, and all
their money were necessary, and the whole not enough;
so that they had not the power to lend troops, ships, or
guineas to the Emperor, the King of Prussia, the Grand
Seignior, nor the Empress of Russia. If they had been
wise, made peace with America, acknowledged her equal
station with the powers of the earth, and conciliated as
much as they then might have done, her affection and her
commerce, they might have preserved their importance in
Europe at the peace of Teschen and the other peace.
But my Lord Shelburne should have remembered, that
he was at that time as much against acknowledging American
independence, and as much for prosecuting the war
against America as the Ministers; so that it does not appear,
that his wisdom was so much greater than theirs. I
am glad, however, that his Lordship is convinced, and I
hope some time or other the Minister will be; but they
have all called us rebels, till they have turned their own
heads. This word rebellion makes Englishmen mad;
they still continue to use it, and by this means as well as
many others, to nourish and cherish the most rancorous
and malignant passions in their own bosoms against us, and
they will continue to do so a long time to come.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 12th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The following is given in the public papers; as a copy
of the bill proposed by Governor Pownal, on the 24th of
May, for putting Great Britain in a situation for making
peace with America.</p>

<p>"In order to remove all doubts or disabilities, which
may prevent, obstruct, or delay the happy work of peace,
may it please your Majesty, that it may be declared and
enacted, and it is hereby declared and enacted, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"That his Majesty is empowered to make a convention
or truce, or to conclude a peace with the inhabitants
of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island,
and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, the three Delaware Counties, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, in
North America, convened in Congress, or in any other
Assembly or Assemblies, or with any person or persons
authorised to act for, and in behalf of the same, in such
form and manner as he, by virtue of the prerogative of his
Crown hath power to do in all other cases, and on such
terms and conditions, as in the course of events shall become
convenient and necessary for the honor and welfare
of his Majesty and his people. And in order thereto, be
it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after
the passing of this act, it shall, and may be lawful, for his
Majesty to appoint such person or persons (subjects of
Great Britain) as his Majesty in his wisdom shall think fit,
and fully to authorise and empower the same to treat, consult,
and agree with the said Americans, or with any part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of them, or with any person or persons acting for and in
their behalf to the said purpose of convention, truce, or
peace. And be it further enacted, that from and after the
passing of this act, it shall, and may be lawful, for his Majesty
to grant safe conduct to any such person or persons
whatsoever, as his Majesty shall see cause and judge
proper to receive on the ground of treaty for such convention,
truce, or peace, in like manner as he is by divers
ancient statutes empowered to do in the cases therein
specified."</p>

<p>On the 19th of May, at a meeting of the wholesale merchants
of Dublin, and several merchants of the out-ports,
convened by the committee of merchants, the following
resolutions were unanimously agreed to.</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That this kingdom cannot possibly derive
any material advantages from a free trade with the British
Islands in the West Indies, without securing a market here
for raw sugar; that being the capital article here of the
produce of those Islands, and the principal return to be
obtained for any manufactures of Ireland, which may be
exported to the British Colonies.</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That a market here for our raw sugar, can
only be secured in a tolerable degree, by laying an additional
duty on refined sugar, of sixteen shillings and seven
pence half penny per hundred weight, being three times
the additional duty to which the raw material is intended
to be subjected.</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That we view with the utmost concern and
astonishment, a measure likely to be adopted, not only
destructive of the sugar refinery of this kingdom, but, consequently,
frustrating the professed benefits held out to
Ireland on laying open to her the Colony trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That we verily believe this to be the insidious
intention of those in Great Britain who have suggested
the measure.</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That we cannot but hold in the utmost contempt
and detestation, every Irishman of whatever rank or
station, who, from private and selfish considerations, shall
prove base enough to be subservient to the insidious purpose
of those, who aim at baffling and defeating the commercial
interests of this too long oppressed and unkindly
treated country.</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That if we find the commercial interests of
our country deserted, where we have and ought to expect
guardianship, whether from ignorance of the subject, misrepresentations
received and too easily listened to, or any
other cause, it will then be incumbent on us, as the only
remedy for self preservation, to enter along with our fellow-citizens
and countrymen, of whose general concurrence
on such a necessary occasion we entertain no doubt, into
such an effectual association against the importation and
use of the manufactures of this kingdom, as may secure to
the industry of Irishmen, the benefits at least of their own
consumption.</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That a committee be appointed to transmit
copies of these resolutions to the merchants of the principal
trading towns in this kingdom, and that the said committee
do consist of Mr Hartley, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That the committee be empowered to convene
a general meeting when they shall think fit."</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, Mr. Martin, in the House of Commons
of Ireland, after having laid open in great detail, the
increase which had crept in by degrees upon the civil establishment
of Ireland, proposed that a committee should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
appointed, and especially instructed to examine into this
alarming augmentation, and to propose a plan of economy,
by means of which they might lighten the burden of the
civil establishment of Ireland of the useless weight, which
overloaded it; but he withdrew his motion on account of
the shortness of the time and the assurance that was given
him, that this object should be one of the first attended to
next session.</p>

<p>On the 17th, the House in a committee of ways and
means, resolved upon a duty of five shillings and tenpence
per hundred weight to be laid on refined sugar, imported
from England.</p>

<p>On the 18th, they were about to confirm the resolution,
when an opposition arose, and Mr Yelverton spoke with
so much energy, that the next day, the 19th, the House
resolved upon a duty of twelve shillings, to the great detriment
of the refiners of sugar at London. Mr Yelverton's
oratory was neither more nor less, than that he would head
the people, the only argument which carries any decisive
weight in that House, and this very seldom fails.</p>

<p>Nothing which is now, or will soon be interesting to the
commerce and navigation of the United States, is improper
for me to send to Congress.</p>

<p>The port Vendres, situated in Roussillon, twenty leagues
from Barcelona and four from Roses, upon the coast of
the Mediterranean, having been a long time filled up and
abandoned, the King has ordered the reparation of it, and
it is now in a condition to receive not only merchant vessels
of any size, but frigates, and will very soon be fit for
ships of the line. This port, the position of which forms
the centre of the coast of the Mediterranean, receives by
its right all that comes out of the Straits, and by its left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
what comes from the Levant and the coast of Italy, at the
passage of the Gulf of Lyon; and it presents to all the
commercial nations, not only a center of union, the most
advantageous for reciprocal commerce, but at the same
time a mart, and an asylum so much the more safe, as
this port is sheltered from all the winds by the mountains,
which surround it, and as vessels are there as quiet as in a
canal, and as it is not yet known but to those who within a
year past have taken refuge in bad weather, and have
owed their safety to it, several having perished for want of
knowing it, they have given two points by which to know
it, by painting white the fort St Elme, and the tower of
Massane, placed upon the highest mountain of the Pyrenees,
which are seen at the distance of fifteen or twenty
leagues at sea, and they have placed at the entrance of the
port a lighthouse, which throws its light more than five
leagues in the night. Roussillon, moreover, can furnish
by itself wines of the first quality, oils, iron, silks, and wools,
almost as beautiful as those of Spain, and many other productions.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 16th 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have lately obtained a sight of a number of pamphlets,
published in London, which are given out as written by Mr
Galloway, but there are many circumstances in them which
convince me they are written in concert by the refugees.
I see many traces, which appear unequivocal, of the hand of
Governor Hutchinson in some of them. I have read them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
with pleasure and surprise, because it seems to me, that if
their professed intention had been to convince America,
that it is both her interest and duty to support her sovereignty
and her alliance, they could not have taken a method
so effectual.</p>

<p>"Such treaties" says he, (that is an offensive and defensive
alliance between France and America) "will naturally
coincide with their several views and interests, as soon as
American Independence shall be acknowledged by the powers
of Europe. America will naturally wish, while she is
rising from her infant state into opulence and power, to
cover her dominions under the protection of France, and
France will find new resources of strength in American
commerce, armies and naval force.</p>

<p>"The recovery of America from the disasters and distresses
of war will be rapid and sudden. Very unlike an
old country whose population is full, and whose cultivation,
commerce and strength, have arrived at their height, the
multiplication of her numbers, and the increase of her power
will surpass all expectation. If her sudden growth has
already exceeded the most sanguine ideas, it is certain, that
the increase of her strength, when supported and assisted
by France, and pushed forward by the powerful motives
arising from her separate interest, her own preservation,
and the prospect of her own arising glory and importance
among nations, will far outrun any idea we have had of her
late population. Nor will it be the interest of America to
check the ambition of France, while confined to Europe.
Her distance, and the safety arising from it, will render her
regardless of the fate of nations on this side of the Atlantic,
as soon as her own strength shall be established. The
prosperity or ruin of kingdoms, from whose power she can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
have nothing to fear, and whose assistance she can never
want, will be matters of equal indifference. She can wish
for no other connexion with Europe than that of commerce,
and this will be better secured in the hands of an
ally than in those with whom she holds <em>no</em> other connexion.
(The word <em>no</em> is an evident error in the press.) So
that it will be of little concern to her whether Great Britain,
Spain, Holland, Germany, or Russia, shall be ruled
by one or more monarchs. The new States are and will
continue the allies of France, our natural enemy, unless reduced,
and although at this time by far the greater part of the
people wish and hope for an union with this country, and
are ready to unite with us in reducing the power of their
tyrants, in the moment the least encouragement shall be
given for that purpose, which the infatuated policy of every
commander has hitherto withheld, yet should they be disappointed
in their hope, it will compel them to unite with
the enemies of this kingdom.</p>

<p>"The mode of carrying on the war, more cruel to
friends than to foes, added to the inhumanity and treachery
of this country, in not exerting its powers for their relief,
will not fail to create permanent enmity and resentment,
and the obligations of gratitude to the nation, which shall
save them from our ravages, will stamp impressions never
to be effaced. Advantage will be taken of these dispositions
by the policy of France, to establish treaties of alliance
and commerce with them, which will be founded on
two great principles, their own mutual interest and the subduing
the power of Great Britain; and if she should be
permitted to trade with them at all, it will only be to share
with other nations in the worthless remains, after their own
and the purposes of their allies are served."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>Here Congress will see the extreme ignorance or deception
of the writer, in affirming, that the "far greater
part of the people wish and hope for a union with Great
Britain, and are ready to unite in reducing," &amp;c. But
notwithstanding the bad faith of the writer, we see that
such is the force of truth, that he cannot adduce an argument
to persuade the English to continue the war, without
producing at the same time a much stronger argument to
persuade the Americans to adhere to the last to their sovereignty
and their alliances. Of this nature are all his
other arguments.</p>

<p>"With the Independence of America," says he, "we
must give up our fisheries on the Bank of Newfoundland,
and in the American seas." Supposing this to be true, which
it is in part, but not in the whole, if Great Britain loses her
fisheries, does not America gain them? Are they not an
object then to America, as important and desirable as to
Great Britain? Has not America then at least as strong
and pressing a motive to fight for them as Great Britain?
The question then is reduced to another, which has the
best prospect of contending for them successfully? America,
favored by all the world, or Great Britain thwarted
and opposed by all the world. And to whom did God
and nature give them? The English lay great stress upon
the gifts of God and nature, as they call the advantage of
their insular situation, to justify their injustice and hostilities
against all the maritime powers of the world. Why
should the Americans hold the blessings of Providence in
a lower estimation, which they can enjoy, without doing
injury to any nation or individual whatsoever?</p>

<p>"With American independence, we must give up thirtyfive
thousand American seamen, and twentyeight thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
more bred and maintained in those excellent nurseries the
fisheries. Our valuable trade, carried on from thence
with the Roman Catholic States, will be in the hands of
America. These nurseries and this trade will ever remain
the natural right of the people who inhabit that country.
A trade so profitable, and a nursery of seamen so
excellent and so necessary for the support of her naval
force, will never be given up, or even divided by America
with any power whatsoever."</p>

<p>If Great Britain loses sixtythree thousand seamen by
our independence, and I believe she will not lose much
less, I mean in the course of a few years, will not America
gain them? Are sixtythree thousand seamen a feebler
bulwark for America than Great Britain? Are they weaker
instruments of wealth and strength, of power and
glory, in the hands of Americans, than in those of the
English; at the command of Congress than at the command
of the King of England? Are they not then as
strong a temptation to us to continue the war, as to them?
The question then recurs again, which has the fairest prospect
of success? America, which grows stronger every
year, or England, which grows weaker?</p>

<p>"The British islands," he adds, "in the West Indies
must fall of course. The same power that can compel
Great Britain to yield up America, will compel her to give
up the West Indies. They are evidently the immediate
objects of France."</p>

<p>The true political consequence from this is to stop short,
make peace, and save the British islands while you can;
once taken, it will be more difficult to get them back.
The whole returns again to the question, are you able to
keep peace at home and in Ireland, and the East Indies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to settle matters with the maritime powers, and go on with
the war long enough to beat France and Spain, make them
renounce the war, and after that reduce the United States
of America to submission? Will your soldiers, your seamen,
and your revenues hold out till this is done, and after
it shall be done, be sufficient to keep up a force sufficient
to keep down France, Spain, and America?</p>

<p>"France," he subjoins, "expects from the independence
of America, and the acquisition of the West India Islands,
the sovereignty of the British seas, if not of Great Britain
itself."</p>

<p>Is not this the strongest of all arguments for putting an
end to the war? Now you may make peace, and keep
the West India Islands, and secure the neutrality at least of
America for the future; and in this case you may at least
maintain your own sovereignty, and the freedom of the
British seas. France at present claims no more than freedom
on any seas. If you make peace at present, you
may have more of American trade in future than France,
and derive more support to your navy than she will to her
marine from that country, and consequently may preserve
your liberty upon all seas; but by pushing the war you
will weaken yourselves and strengthen France and Spain
to such a degree, that they will have in the end such a
superiority as may endanger your liberty. But if Great
Britain is to lose the West India Islands, and the sovereignty
of the seas, by the independence of America,
surely France, Spain, or America, or all three together
are to gain them. And are not these advantages as tempting
to these powers as to England, and as urgent motives
to pursue the war?</p>

<p>So that we come again to the old question, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
likely to hold it out longest? The immense inexhaustible
resources of France, Spain, and America together, or the
ruined, exhausted, or distracted kingdom of Great Britain.
The writer goes on. "France has long struggled to rival
us in our manufactures in vain; this will enable her to do
it with effect." If England were to make peace now, it
is very doubtful whether France would be able to rival her
in manufactures, those I mean which are most wanted in
America, of wool and iron. But if she continues the war,
France will be very likely to rival her, to effect, as it is
certain she is taking measures for the purpose and the longer
the war continues, the more opportunity she will have
of pursuing those measures to effect.</p>

<p>"We receive," says he, "from the West India Islands,
certain commodities absolutely necessary to carry on our
manufactures to any advantage and extent, and which we
can procure from no other country. We must take the
remains from France or America, after they have supplied
themselves and fulfilled their contracts with their allies, at
their own prices, and loaded with the expense of foreign
transportation, if we are permitted to trade for them at all."
Is it possible to demonstrate the necessity of making peace,
now while we may, more clearly? We may now preserve
the West India Islands, but continuing the war we lose
them infallibly.</p>

<p>"But this is not all we shall lose with the West Indies,"
says the writer. "We must add to our loss of seamen
sustained by the independence of America, at least twenty
thousand more, who have been bred and maintained in the
trade from Great Britain to the West Indies, and in the
West India trade among themselves, and with other parts,
amounting in the whole to upwards of eighty thousand; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
loss, which cannot fail to affect the sensibility of every
man who loves this country, and knows that its safety can
only be secured by its navy."</p>

<p>Is not this full proof of the necessity of making peace?
These seamen may now be saved, with the islands whose
commerce supports them. But if we continue the war,
will France and Spain be less zealous to conquer your
islands? Because, by this means they will certainly take
away from you, and divide among themselves, twenty thousand
seamen. Taking these islands from you, and annexing
them to France and Spain, will in fact increase the
trade of France, Spain, the United Provinces of the Low
Countries, the United States of America, and Denmark;
and the twenty thousand seamen will be divided in some
proportion among all these powers. The Dutch and the
Americans will have the carriage of a good deal of this
trade, in consequence of their dismemberment from you,
and annexion to France and Spain; do you expect to save
these things by continuing the war? Or that these powers
will be less zealous to continue it, by your holding out to
them such temptations?</p>

<p>"Will not Great Britain lose much of her independence
in the present state of Europe," continues the writer, "while
she is obliged to other countries for her naval stores? In
the time of Queen Anne, we paid at Stockholm three
pounds per barrel for pitch and tar, to the extortionate
Swede; and such was the small demand of those countries
for the manufactures of this, that the balance of trade
was greatly in their favor. The gold which we obtained
in our other commerce, was continually pouring into their
laps. But we have reduced that balance, by our importation
of large quantities of those supplies from America."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>But what is there to hinder Great Britain from importing
pitch, tar, and turpentine from America, after her independence?
She may be obliged to give a somewhat
higher price, because France, Spain, Holland, and all
other nations will import them too. But will this higher
price induce America to give up her independence? Will
the prospect which is opened to the other maritime powers
of drawing these supplies from America, in exchange
for their productions, make them less zealous to support
American independence? Will the increase of the demand
upon the northern powers for these articles, in consequence
of the destruction of the British monopoly in
America, make these powers less inclined to American
independency? The British monopoly and British bounties,
it was in fact, which reduced the price of these articles
in the northern markets. The ceasing of that monopoly
and those bounties, will rather raise the price in the
Baltic, because those States in America in which pitch
and tar chiefly grow, have so many articles of more profitable
cultivation, that without bounties it is not probable that
trade will flourish to a degree, to reduce the prices in the
north of Europe. Should a war take place between us
and the northern powers, where are we to procure our
naval stores? inquires the pamphleteer.</p>

<p>I answer, make peace with America, and procure them
from her. But if you go to war with America and the
Northern Powers at once, you will get them nowhere.
This writer appears to have had no suspicion of the real
intentions of the Northern Powers, when he wrote his book.
What he will say now after the confederation of all of them
against Great Britain, for I can call it no otherwise, I am
at a loss to conjecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>"Timber of every kind, iron, saltpetre, tar, pitch, turpentine,
and hemp, are raised and manufactured in America.
Fields, of a hundred thousand acres, of hemp, are
to be seen spontaneously growing between the Ohio and
the Mississippi, and of a quality little inferior to the European."</p>

<p>Are not these articles as precious to France, Spain,
and Holland as to England? Will not these powers be
proportionably active to procure a share of them, or a liberty
to trade in them, as England will be to defend her
monopoly of them? And will not America be as alert to
obtain the freedom of selling them to the best advantage in
a variety of markets as other nations will for that of purchasing
them?</p>

<p>Will the coasting trade, and that of the Baltic and Mediterranean,
with the small intercourse we have in our bottoms
with other nations, furnish seamen sufficient for a
navy necessary for the protection of Great Britain and its
trade? Will our mariners continue as they are, when our
manufactures are laboring under the disadvantage of receiving
their materials at higher and exorbitant prices, and
selling at foreign markets at a certain loss. Will these
nurseries of seamen, thus weakened, supply the loss of
eighty thousand, sustained by the independence of America,
and the conquest of the West Indies?</p>

<p>But what is the tendency of this? If it serves to convince
Britain that she should continue the war, does it not
serve to convince the allies that they ought to continue it
too? For they are to get all that Britain is to lose, and
America is to be the greatest gainer of all; whereas she is
not only to lose these objects, but her liberties too, if she is
subdued. France, Spain, and all the other maritime powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
are to gain a share of these objects, if Britain loses
them; whereas they not only lose all share in them, but
even the safety and existence of their flags upon the ocean
may be lost, if America is reduced, and the British monopoly
of American trade, fisheries, and seamen is revived.</p>

<p>"It does not require the spirit of divination to perceive
that Great Britain, robbed of her foreign dominions and
commerce, her nurseries of seamen lost, her navy weakened,
and the power of her ambitious neighbors thus
strengthened and increased, will not be able to maintain
her independence among the nations."</p>

<p>If she would now make peace, she might preserve not
only her independence, but a great share of her present
importance. If she continues this war but a year or two
longer, she will be reduced to the government of her own
island, in two independent kingdoms, Scotland and England
probably. As to conquest and subordination to some
neighboring power, none that has common sense would
accept the government of that island, because it would cost
infinitely more to maintain it than it would be worth.</p>

<p>Thus I have given some account of these "cool thoughts
on the consequences of American independence," which I
consider as the result of all the consultations and deliberations
of the refugees upon the subject.</p>

<p>I think it might as well have been entitled, an Essay
towards demonstrating that it is the clear interest and the
indispensable duty of America, to maintain her sovereignty
and her alliances at all events, and of France, Spain, Holland,
and all the maritime powers to support her in the possession
of them.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 16th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have just received a letter from Nantes, brought in a

<p><em>P. S.</em> I have mislaid the letter from Boston. The

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 17th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>The refugees in England are so great an obstacle to
peace, that it seems not improper for me to take notice
of them to Congress. Governor Hutchinson is dead.
Whether the late popular insurrections, or whether the
resolutions of Congress of the 18th of March, respecting
their finances, by suddenly extinguishing the last rays of
his hopes, put a sudden end to his life, or whether it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
owing to any other cause, I know not. He was born to
be the cause and the victim of popular fury, outrage, and
conflagrations. Descended from an ancient and honorable
family, born and educated in America, professing all the
zeal of the congregational religion, affecting to honor the
characters of the first planters of the new world, and to
vindicate the character of America, and especially of
New England, early initiated into public business, industrious
and indefatigable in it, beloved and esteemed by the
people, elected and trusted by them and their representatives,
his views opened and extended by repeated travels
in Europe, engaged in extensive correspondence in Europe
as well as in America, favored by the Crown of
Great Britain, and possessed of its honors and emoluments;
possessed of all these advantages and surrounded by all
these circumstances, he was perhaps the only man in the
world who could have brought on the controversy between
Great Britain and America, in the manner and at the time
it was done, and involved the two countries in an enmity,
which must end in their everlasting separation. Yet this
was the character of the man, and these his memorable
actions. An inextinguishable ambition and avarice, that
were ever seen among his other qualities, and which grew
with his growth and strengthened with his age and experience,
and at last predominated over every other principle
of his heart, rendered him credulous to a childish
degree, of everything that favored his ruling passion, and
blind and deaf to everything that thwarted it, to such a
degree, that his representations, with those of his fellow-laborer,
Bernard, drew on the King, Ministry, Parliament,
and nation, to concert measures, which will end in their
reduction and the exaltation of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>I think I see visible traces of his councils in a number
of pamphlets, not long since published in London, and ascribed
to Mr Galloway. It is most probable, that they
were concerted between the Ministry and the refugees in
general, and that Mr Galloway was to be given out as the
ostensible, as he probably was the principal author.</p>

<p>"The cool thoughts on the consequences of American independence,"
although calculated to inflame a hasty warlike
nation to pursue the conquest of America, are sober reasons
for defending our independence and our alliances, and therefore
proper for me to lay before my countrymen. The pamphlet
says, "it has been often asserted, that Great Britain
has expended in settling and defending America, more
than she will ever be able to repay, and that it will be
more to the profit of this kingdom to give her independence,
and to lose what we have expended, than to retain
her as a part of her dominions." To this he answers, "that
the bounties on articles of commerce, and the expense of
the last war, ought not to be charged to America, and that
the sums expended in support of Colonial governments,
have been confined to New York, the Carolinas, Georgia,
Nova Scotia, and East and West Florida. That New
England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware,
and Virginia, have not cost Great Britain a farthing, and
that the whole expense of the former is no more than
£1,700,000, and when we deduct the £700,000, extravagantly
expended in building a key at Halifax, we can only
call it one million." He concludes, "that posterity will
feel that America was not only worth all that was spent
upon her, but that a just, firm, and constitutional subordination
of the Colonies, was absolutely necessary to the independence
and existence of Great Britain." Here I
think I see the traces of Mr Hutchinson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>Another argument, he says, much relied on by the advocates
for American independence is, "that a similarity of
laws, religion, and manners, has formed an attachment between
the people of Great Britain and America, which
will ensure to Great Britain a preference in the commerce
of America." He agrees, "that a uniformity of laws and
religion, united with a subordination to the same supreme
authority, in a great measure forms and fixes the national
attachment. But when the laws and the supreme authority
are abolished, the manners, habits, and customs derived
from them will soon be effaced. When different
systems of laws and governments shall be established,
other habits and manners must take place. The fact is,
that the Americans have already instituted governments,
as opposite to the principles upon which the British government
is established as human invention could possibly
devise. New laws are made, and will be made in conformity
to, and in support of their new political systems,
and of course destructive to this national attachment.
Their new States being altogether popular, their essential
laws do already, and will continue to bear a greater resemblance
to those of the democratical Cantons of Switzerland,
than to the laws and policy of Great Britain.
Thus we find, in their first acts, the strongest of all proofs
of an aversion in their rulers to our national policy, and a
sure foundation laid to obliterate all affection and attachment
to this country among the people. How long then
can we expect that their attachment, arising from a similarity
of laws, habits, and manners, if any such should remain,
will continue? No longer than between the United
Provinces and Spain, or the Corsicans and the Genoese,
which was changed, from the moment of their separation,
into an enmity, which is not worn out to this day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>How it is possible for these rulers, who are the creatures
of the people, and constantly dependent upon them
for their political existence, to have the strongest aversion
to the national policy of Great Britain, and at the same
time the far greater part of the people wish and hope for a
union with that country, and are ready to unite in reducing
the powers of those rulers, as this author asserts, I know
not. I leave him to reconcile it. If he had been candid,
and confessed that the attachment in American minds in
general is not very strong to the laws and government of
England, and that they rather prefer a different form of
government, I should have agreed with him, as I certainly
shall agree, that no attachment between nations arising
merely from a similarity of laws and government, is ever
very strong, or sufficient to bind nations together, who
have opposite or even different interests.</p>

<p>"As to attachments," says he, "arising from a similarity
of religion, they will appear still more groundless and ridiculous.
America has no predominant religion. There is
not a religious society in Europe, which is not to be found
in America. If we wish to visit the churches of England,
or the meetings of the Lutherans, Methodists, Calvinists,
Presbyterians, Moravians, Menonists, Swinfielders, Dumplers,
or Roman Catholics, we shall find them all in America.</p>

<p>"What a motley, or rather how many different and opposite
attachments, will this jumble of religions make.</p>

<p>"Should there be any remains of this kind of national
attachment, we may conclude, that the Lutherans, Calvinists,
Menonists, Swinfielders, Dumplers, and Moravians,
will be attached to Germany, the country from whence
they emigrated, and where their religions are best tolerated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the Presbyterians and Puritans to Ireland, and the
Roman Catholics to France, Spain, and the Pope, and the
small number of the Church of England to Great Britain.</p>

<p>"Do we not daily see, Monarchies at war with Monarchies,
Infidels with Infidels, Christians with Christians,
Catholics with Catholics, and Dissenters with Dissenters?
What stress then can be justly laid on an attachment arising
from a similarity of laws, government, or religion?</p>

<p>"It has also been asserted, that America will be led
from motives of interest, to give the preference in trade to
this country, because we can supply her with manufactures
cheaper than she can raise them or purchase them
from others.</p>

<p>"But a commercial alliance is already ratified, greatly
injurious to the trade of Great Britain, and should France
succeed in supporting American independence, no one can
doubt but other treaties, yet more injurious, will be added;
and as to the ability of America to manufacture, she possesses,
or can produce a greater variety of raw materials,
than any other country on the globe. When she shall
have a separate and distinct interest of her own to pursue,
her views will be enlarged, her policy exerted to her own
benefit, and her interest instead of being united with, will
become not only different from, but opposite to that of
Great Britain. She will readily perceive, that manufactures
are the great foundation of commerce, that commerce
is the great means of acquiring wealth, and that
wealth is necessary to her own safety. With these interesting
prospects before her, it is impossible to conceive,
that she will not exert her capacity to promote manufactures
and commerce. She will see it to be clearly her
interest not only to manufacture for herself but others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Laws will be made granting bounties to encourage it, and
duties will be laid to discourage or prohibit foreign importations.
By these measures her manufactures will increase,
her commerce will be extended; and feeling the
benefits of them as they rise, her industry will be excited,
until she shall not only supply her own wants, but those of
Great Britain herself, with all the manufactures made with
her own materials. The nature of commerce is roving;
she has been at different periods in possession of the Phoenicians,
Carthaginians, and the Venetians; Germany and
France lately enjoyed her, and supplied Great Britain with
their manufactures. Great Britain at present folds her in
her arms."</p>

<p>Surely it was never intended that any American should
read this pamphlet, it contains so many arguments and
motives for perseverance in our righteous and glorious
cause. It is astonishing, however, that, instead of stimulating
England to pursue their unjust and inglorious enterprise,
it does not convince all of the impracticability of it,
and induce them to make peace.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 20th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Last evening I received the letter, an extract of which
I have the honor to enclose. It is from Mr Gerry, a
member of Congress, who has been a member of their
Treasury Board from the beginning of the year 1776.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>It is much to be regretted, that the Congress did not
publish their resolution to pay off the loan office certificates,
according to the value of money, at the time of
their being respectively issued, with their resolutions of the
18th of March; because this I think would have prevented
the alarm, that has been spread in Europe. It will be
found, that almost all the interest that European merchants
or others have in our funds, lies in these certificates, and
that almost all the paper bills now in possession of their
factors in America, have been received within a few
months; immediately before the 18th of March, and consequently
received at a depreciation of forty for one, at
least, perhaps at a much greater.</p>

<p>Although some Europeans may have considerable sums
in loan office certificates, yet I have reason to believe, that
the whole will be found much less than is imagined.
They have realized their property generally as they went
along. Some may have purchased land, others have purchased
bills of exchange, others have purchased the produce
of the country, which they have exported to St
Eustatia, to the French West India Islands, and to Europe.</p>

<h3>COUNT DE VERGENNES TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p class="head">
Versailles, June 21st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you did me the honor
to write me on the 16th of this month, and also the extract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of the letter addressed to you from Boston, dated the 26th
of April.</p>

<p>From this it appears, that the Assembly of Massachusetts
has determined to adopt the resolution of Congress,
fixing the value of the paper money at forty for one in
specie. On reading that resolution, I was persuaded, that
it had no other object than that of restoring the value of
the paper money by lessening its quantity, and that in consequence
of that operation the paper not brought in would
take its course according to the circumstances, that would
give it a greater or less degree of credit. What confirmed
me in this opinion, was the liberty given to the possessors of
the paper money to carry it to the treasury of their State,
or to keep it in their own possession. But from the information
I have since received, and the letter, which you have
been pleased to communicate to me, I have reason to believe,
that it is the intention of Congress to maintain the
paper money invariably at the exchange of forty for one,
and to settle on that footing all the paper money, which
has been thrown into circulation, in order to reduce insensibly
the two hundred millions of dollars, for which it is
indebted, to five millions.</p>

<p>I will not presume, Sir, to criticise upon this operation,
because I have no right to examine or comment upon the
internal arrangements, which Congress may consider as
just and profitable; and moreover I readily agree, that there
may be some situations so critical as to force the best regulated
and best established governments to adopt extraordinary
measures to repair their finances, and put them in a
condition to answer the public expenses; and this I am
persuaded has been the principal reason, that induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Congress to depreciate the money, which they themselves
have emitted.</p>

<p>But while I admit, Sir, that that Assembly might have
recourse to the expedient abovementioned in order to remove
their load of debt, I am far from agreeing, that it
is just, or agreeable to the ordinary course of things to extend
the effect to strangers, as well as to citizens of the
United States. On the contrary, I think it ought to be
confined to Americans, and that an exception ought to be
made in favor of strangers, or at least, that some means
ought to be devised to indemnify them, for the losses they
may suffer by the general laws.</p>

<p>In order to make you sensible of the truth of this observation,
I will only remark, Sir, that the Americans alone
ought to support the expense, which is occasioned by the
defence of their liberty, and that they ought to consider
the depreciation of their paper money, only as an impost
which ought to fall upon themselves, as the paper money
was at first established only to relieve them from the necessity
of paying taxes. I will only add, that the French,
if they are obliged to submit to the reduction proposed by
Congress, will find themselves victims of their zeal, and I
may say of the rashness, with which they exposed themselves
in furnishing the Americans with arms, ammunition,
and clothing; and in a word, with all things of the first necessity,
of which the Americans at the time stood in need.
You will agree with me, Sir, that this is not what the subjects
of the King ought to expect, and that after escaping
the dangers of the sea, the vigilance of the English, instead
of dreading to see themselves plundered in America,
they ought on the contrary, to expect the thanks of Congress,
and of all the Americans, and believe, that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
property will be as secure and sacred in America as in
France itself.</p>

<p>It was with this persuasion, and in a reliance on public
faith, that they received paper money in exchange for their
merchandise, and kept that paper with a view to employ it
in new speculations of commerce. The unexpected reduction
of this paper overturns all their calculations at the
same time that it ruins their fortune. I ask, Sir, if these
consequences can induce you to believe, that this act of
Congress is proper to advance the credit of the United
States, to inspire a confidence in their promises, to invite
the European nations to run the same risks, to which the
subjects of his Majesty have exposed themselves?</p>

<p>These, Sir, are the principal reflections occasioned by
the resolution of Congress of the 18th of March. I
thought it my duty to communicate them to you with an
entire confidence, because you are too enlightened not to
feel their force and justice, and too much attached to your
country, not to use all your endeavors to engage it to take
steps to do justice to the subjects of the King.</p>

<p>I will not conceal from you, that the Chevalier de la
Luzerne has received orders to make the strongest representations
on this subject, and that the King is firmly persuaded,
that the United States will be forward to give to
him, on this occasion, a mark of their attachment by granting
to his subjects the just satisfaction, which they solicit
and expect, from the wisdom and justice of the United
States.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 22d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received this day the letter, which your Excellency
did me the honor to write me on the 21st of this month.</p>

<p>I thank your Excellency for the confidence, which induced
you to communicate this letter to me, and the continuance
of which I shall ever study to deserve.</p>

<p>When your Excellency says, that his Majesty's Minister
at Congress has already received orders to make representations
against the resolutions of Congress of the 18th of
March, as far as they effect his subjects, I am at a loss to
know with certainty, whether your Excellency means only,
that such orders have lately passed, and are sent off to go
to America, or whether you mean, that such orders were
sent so long ago as to have reached the hand of the Chevalier
de la Luzerne.</p>

<p>If the latter is your Excellency's meaning, there is no
remedy; if the former, I would submit it to your Excellency's
consideration, whether those orders may not be
stopped and delayed a little time, until his Excellency Mr
Franklin may have opportunity to make his representations
to his Majesty's Ministers, to the end, that if it should appear,
that those orders were issued in consequence of misinformation,
they may be revoked, otherwise sent on.</p>

<p>I will do myself the honor to write fully to your Excellency
upon this subject without loss of time, and although
it is a subject on which I pretend not to an accurate
knowledge in the detail, yet I flatter myself I am so far
master of the principles as to demonstrate, that the plan of
Congress is not only wise, but just.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 22d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I this day acknowledge the receipt of the letter, which
you did me the honor to write to me on the 21st.</p>

<p>I have the honor to agree with your Excellency in
opinion, that it is the intention of Congress to redeem all
their paper bills which are extant, at an exchange of forty
for one, by which means, the two hundred millions of dollars,
which are out, will be reduced to about five millions.</p>

<p>I apprehend, with your Excellency, that it was necessary
for the Congress to put themselves in a condition
to defray the public expenses. They found their currency
to be so depreciated, and so rapidly depreciating,
that a further emission sufficient to discharge the public
expenses another year, would have, probably, depreciated
it to two hundred for one; perhaps, would have so totally
discredited it, that nobody would have taken it at any rate.
It was absolutely necessary, then, to stop emitting. Yet
it was absolutely necessary to have an army to save their
cities from the fire, and their citizens from the sword.
That army must be fed, clothed, paid, and armed, and
other expenses must be defrayed. It had become necessary,
therefore, at this time, to call in their paper; for
there is no nation that is able to carry on war by the
taxes, which can be raised within the year. But I am far
from thinking, that this necessity was the cause of their
calling it in at a depreciated value, because I am well
convinced that they would have called it in at a depreciated
value, if the British fleet and army had been withdrawn
from the United States, and a general peace had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
been concluded. My reason for this belief is, the evident
injustice of calling it in at its nominal value, a silver dollar
for a paper one. The public has its rights as well as individuals;
and every individual has a share in the rights of
the public. Justice is due to the body politic, as well as
to the possessor of the bills; and to have paid off the bills
at their nominal value, would have wronged the body
politic of thirtynine dollars in every forty, as really as if
forty dollars had been paid for one, at the first emission in
1775, when each paper dollar was worth, and would fetch
a silver one.</p>

<p>I beg leave to ask your Excellency, whether you judge
that the Congress ought to pay two hundred millions of
silver dollars, for the two hundred millions of paper dollars
which are abroad? I presume your Excellency will
not think that they ought; because I have never met with
any man in America or in Europe, that was of that opinion.
All agree, that Congress ought to redeem it at a
depreciated value. The only question then, is, at what
depreciation? Shall it be at seventyfive, forty, thirty,
twenty, ten, or five, for one? After it is once admitted,
that it ought to be redeemed at a less value than the nominal,
the question arises, at what value? What rule? I answer,
there is no other rule of justice than the current
value, the value at which it generally passes from man to
man. The Congress have set it at forty for one; and
they are the best judges of this, as they represent all parts
of the continent where the paper circulates.</p>

<p>I think there can be little need of illustration; but two
or three examples may make my meaning more obvious.
A farmer has now four thousand dollars for a pair of oxen,
which he sells to a commissary to subsist the army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
When the money was issued in 1775, he would have been
glad to have taken one hundred. A laborer has now
twenty dollars a day for his work; five years ago, he
would have been rejoiced to have received half a dollar.
The same with the artisan, merchant, and all others, but
those who have fixed salaries, or money at interest. Most
of these persons would be willing to take hard money for
his work and his produce, at the rate he did six years
ago. Where is the reason, then, that Congress should
pay them forty times as much as they take of their neighbors
in private life?</p>

<p>The amount of an ordinary commerce, external and internal,
of a society, may be computed at a fixed sum. A
certain sum of money is necessary to circulate among the
society, in order to carry on their business. This precise
sum is discoverable by calculation, and reducible to certainty.
You may emit paper, or any other currency for
this purpose, until you reach this rule, and it will not depreciate.
After you exceed this rule, it will depreciate;
and no power, or act of legislation hitherto invented, will
prevent it. In the case of paper, if you go on emitting
forever, the whole mass will be worth no more than that
was, which was emitted within the rule. When the paper,
therefore, comes to be redeemed, this is the only rule of
justice for the redemption of it. The Congress have fixed
five millions for this rule. Whether this is mathematically
exact, I am not able to say; whether it is a million too
little, or too much, I know not. But they are the best
judges; and by the accounts of the money being at seventy
for one, and bills of exchange at fiftyfive for one, it
looks as if five millions was too high a sum, rather than
too small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>It will be said, that the faith of society ought to be
sacred, and that the Congress have pledged the public
faith for the redemption of the bills, at the value on the
face of them. I agree that the public faith ought to be
sacred. But who is it that has violated this faith? Is it not
every man, who has demanded more paper money for his
labor or his goods than they were worth in silver? The
public faith, in the sense these words are here used, would
require that Congress should make up to every man,
who for five years past has paid more in paper money
for anything he has purchased, than he could have had it
for in silver. The public faith is no more pledged to the
present possessor of the bills, than it is to every man, through
whose hands they may have passed, at a less value than
the nominal value. So that according to this doctrine,
Congress would have two hundred millions of dollars to
pay to the present possessors of the bills, and to make up to
every man, through whose hands they may have passed, the
difference at which they passed between them and silver.</p>

<p>It should be considered, that every man, whether native
or foreigner, who receives or pays this money at a less
value than the nominal value, breaks this faith. For the
social compact being between the whole and every individual,
and between every individual and the whole, every
individual, native or foreigner, who uses this paper, is as
much bound by the public faith to use it according to the
terms of its emission as the Congress is. And Congress
have as good a right to reproach every individual, who
now demands more paper for his goods than silver, with a
breach of the public faith, as he has to reproach the public
or their representatives.</p>

<p>I must beg your Excellency's excuse for calling your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
attention a little longer to this head of public faith, because
I cannot rest easy, while my country is supposed to be
guilty of a breach of their faith, and in a case where I am
clear they have not been so, especially by your Excellency,
whose good opinion they and I value so much. This public
faith is in the nature of a mutual covenant, and he who
would claim a benefit under it, ought to be careful in first
fulfilling his part of it. When Congress issued their bills,
declaring them, in effect, to be equal to silver, they unquestionably
intended that they should be so considered,
and that they should be received accordingly. The people,
or individuals covenanted, in effect, to receive them at
their nominal value; and Congress, in such case, agreed
on their part to redeem them at the same rate. This
seems to be a fair and plain construction of this covenant,
or public faith; and none other I think can be made, that
will not degenerate into an unconscionable contract, and so
destroy itself.</p>

<p>Can it be supposed, that Congress ever intended, that if
the time should come when the individual refused to accept
and receive their bills at their nominal value, and demanded,
and actually received them at a less value, that,
in that case, the individual should be entitled to demand,
and receive of the public, for those very bills, silver equal
to their nominal value? The consideration is, in fact, made
by the public at the very instant the individual receives the
bills at a discount; and there is a tacit and implied agreement
springing from the principles of natural justice or
equity, between the public and the individual; that as the
latter has not given to the former a consideration equal to
the nominal value of the bills, so in fact, the public shall not
be held to pay the nominal value in silver to the individual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Suppose it otherwise, and how will the matter stand? The
public offers to an individual a bill, whose nominal value is,
for example, forty dollars, in lieu of forty silver dollars;
the individual says, I esteem it of no more value than one
silver dollar, and the public pays it to him at that value;
yet he comes the next day, when the bill may be payable,
and demands of the public forty silver dollars in exchange
for it. And why? Because the bill purports on the face of
it, to be equal to forty silver dollars. The answer is
equally obvious with the injustice of the demand. Upon
the whole, as the depreciation crept in gradually, and was
unavoidable, all reproaches of a breach of public faith
ought to be laid aside; and the only proper inquiry now
really is, what is paper honestly worth? What will it fetch
at market? And this is the only just rule of redemption.</p>

<p>It becomes me to express myself with deference, when
I am obliged to differ in opinion from your Excellency;
but this being a subject peculiar to America, no example
entirely similar to it, that I know of, having been in Europe,
I may be excused, therefore, in explaining my sentiments
upon it.</p>

<p>I have the misfortune to differ from your Excellency, so
far as to think, that no general distinction can be made
between natives and foreigners. For, not to mention that
this would open a door to numberless frauds, I think, that
foreigners when they come to trade with a nation, make
themselves temporary citizens, and tacitly consent to be
bound by the same laws. And it will be found, that foreigners
have had quite as much to do, in depreciating this
money, in proportion, as natives, and that they have been
in proportion much less sufferers by it. I might go
further and say, that they have been in proportion greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
gainers by it, without suffering any considerable share of
the loss.</p>

<p>The paper bills out of America, are next to nothing. I
have no reason to think, that there are ten thousand dollars
in all Europe; indeed, I do not know of one thousand.
The agents in America of merchants in Europe, have laid
out their paper bills in lands, or in indigo, rice, tobacco,
wheat, flour, &amp;c.; in short, in the produce of the country.
This produce they have shipped to Europe, sold to the
King's ships, and received bills of exchange, or shipped to
the West India Islands, where they have procured cash, or
bills of exchange. The surplus they have put into the
loan offices from time to time, for loan offices have been
open all along, from 1776, I believe, to this time. Whenever
any person lent paper bills to the public, and took
loan office certificates, he would have been glad to have
taken silver in exchange for the bills, at their then depreciated
value. Why should he not be willing now? Those
who lent paper, when two paper dollars were worth one in
silver, will have one for two; those who lent, when forty
were worth one, will have one for forty; and those who
lent, when paper was as good as silver, will have dollar for
dollar.</p>

<p>Your Excellency thinks it would be hard, that those
who have escaped the perils of the seas and of enemies,
should be spoiled by their friends. But Congress have not
spoiled any; they have only prevented themselves and the
public from being spoiled. No agent of any European
merchant, in making his calculations of profit and loss,
ever estimated the depreciated bills at the nominal value;
they all put a profit upon their goods sufficient to defray
all expenses of insurance, freight, and everything else, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
had a great profit besides, receiving the bills at the current,
not the nominal value.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to state a few prices current at Boston
the last and the present year, in order to show the profits
which have been made. Bohea tea, forty sous a pound
at L'Orient and Nantes, fortyfive dollars; salt, which costs
very little in Europe, and used to be sold for a shilling a
bushel, forty dollars a bushel, and in some of the other
States, two hundred dollars, at times; linens, which cost
two livres a yard in France, forty dollars a yard; broadcloths,
a louis d'or a yard here, two hundred dollars a yard;
ironmongery of all sorts, one hundred and twenty for one;
millinary of all sorts, at an advance far exceeding. These
were the prices at Boston. At Philadelphia, and in all the
other States, they were much higher. These prices, I
think, must convince your Excellency that allowing one
half, or even two thirds of the vessels to be taken, there is
room enough for a handsome profit, deducting all charges,
and computing the value of bills at the rate of silver at the
time.</p>

<p>There are two other sources from which foreigners have
made great profits. The difference between bills of exchange
and silver. During the whole of our history, when
a man could readily get twentyfive paper dollars for one in
silver, he could not get more than twelve paper dollars for
one, in a bill of exchange. Nearly this proportion was
observed all along, as I have been informed. The Agent
of a foreign merchant had only to sell his goods for paper,
or buy paper with silver at twentyfive for one, and immediately
go and buy bills at twelve for one. So that he
doubled his money in a moment.</p>

<p>Another source was this; the paper money was not alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
depreciated in all places at the same time. It was forty
for one at Philadelphia, sometimes, when it was only
twenty at Boston. The agent of a foreign merchant had
only to sell his goods, or send silver to Philadelphia, and
exchange it for paper, which he could lay out at Boston
for twice what it cost him, and in this way again double
his property.</p>

<p>This depreciating paper currency being, therefore, such
a fruitful source for men of penetration to make large profits,
it is not to be wondered that some have written alarming
letters to their correspondents.</p>

<p>No man is more ready than I am to acknowledge the
obligations we are under to France; but the flourishing
state of her marine and commerce, and the decisive influence
of her councils and negotiations in Europe, which all
the world will allow to be owing in a great measure to the
separation of America from her inveterate enemy, and to
her new connexions with the United States, show that the
obligations are mutual. And no foreign merchant ought to
expect to be treated in America better than her native
merchants, who have hazarded their property through the
same perils of the seas and of enemies.</p>

<p>In the late Province of the Massachusetts Bay, from the
years 1745 to 1750, we had full experience of the operation
of paper money. The Province engaged in expensive
expeditions against Louisburg and Canada, which occasioned
a too plentiful emission of paper money, in consequence
of which, it depreciated to seven and a half for
one. In 1750, the British Parliament granted a sum of
money to the Province to reimburse it, for what it had
expended more than its proportion in the general expense
of the empire. This sum was brought over to Boston in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
silver and gold, and the Legislature determined to redeem
all their paper with it at the depreciated value. There
was a similar alarm at first, and before the matter was understood,
but after the people had time to think upon it,
all were satisfied to receive silver at fifty shillings an ounce,
although the face of the bills promised an ounce of silver
for every six shillings and eight pence. At that time,
the British merchants were more interested in our paper
money, in proportion, than any Europeans now are; yet
they did not charge the Province with a breach of faith, or
stigmatise this as an act of bankruptcy. On the contrary,
they were satisfied with it.</p>

<p>I beg leave to remind your Excellency, that at that
time, the laws of Massachusetts were subject not only to
the negative of the King's Governor, but to a revision by
the King in Council, and were there liable to be affirmed
or annulled. And from the partial preference, which your
Excellency well knows, was uniformly given to the subjects
of the King, within the realm, when they came in
competition with those of the subjects of the Colonies,
there is no reason to doubt, that if that measure, when
thoroughly considered, had been unjust in itself, but the
merchants in England would have taken an alarm, and
procured the act to be disallowed by the King in Council.
Yet the merchants in England, who well understood their
own interests, were quite silent upon this occasion, and the
law was confirmed in the Council; nor can it be supposed
to have been confirmed there in a manner unnoticed. It
had met with too much opposition among a certain set of
interested speculators in the then Province, for that supposition
to be made. And the case of the British merchants,
at that time, differed in no respect from the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
case of the French, or other foreign merchants, except
that the credits of the former were vastly greater, and they
must have, consequently, been more deeply interested in
that measure of government, than the latter are in the
present one. Their acquiescence in the measure, and the
confirmation of that act, must have rested upon the full
conviction of the British administration and of the merchants,
of the justice of it. Your Excellency will agree,
in the difficulty of making any distinction between the
French merchant and the Spanish or Dutch merchant,
by any general rule; for all these are interested in this
business.</p>

<p>Your Excellency is pleased to ask, whether I think
these proceedings of Congress proper to give credit to the
United States; to inspire confidence in their promises, and
to invite the European nations to partake of the same risks,
to which the subjects of his Majesty have exposed themselves?</p>

<p>I have the honor to answer your Excellency, directly
and candidly, that I do think them proper for these ends,
and I do further think them to be the only measures that
ever could acquire credit and confidence to the United
States. I know of no other just foundation of confidence
in men, or bodies of men, than their understanding and
integrity; and Congress have manifested to all the world
by this plan, that they understand the nature of their paper
currency, that its fluctuation has been the grand obstacle
to their credit; and that it was necessary to draw it to a
conclusion, in order to introduce a more steady standard
of commerce; that, to this end, the repeal of their laws,
which made the paper a tender, and giving a free circulation
to silver and gold, were necessary. They have further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
manifested by these resolutions, that they are fully possessed
of the only principle there is in the nature of things
for doing justice in this business, to the public and to individuals,
to natives and foreigners, and that they are sufficiently
possessed of the confidence of the people; and
there is sufficient vigor in their government to carry it into
execution.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all, if any European merchant can show
any good reason for excepting his particular case from the
general rule, upon a representation of it to Congress, I
have no doubt they will do him justice.</p>

<p>Moreover, if his Excellency the Chevalier de la Luzerne
can show, that the sum of five millions of dollars is
not the real worth of all the paper money that is abroad,
and that ten millions of dollars is the true sum, I doubt not
Congress would alter their rule, and redeem it at twenty
for one. But I doubt very much whether this can be
shown. But I cannot see that any distinction could be
made between French merchants and those of other nations,
but what would be very invidious and founded upon
no principle. I cannot see that any distinction can be
made between natives and foreigners, but what would have
a most unhappy effect upon the minds of the people in
America, and be a partiality quite unwarrantable; and,
therefore, your Excellency will see, that it is impossible
for me to take any steps to persuade Congress to retract,
because it would be acting in direct repugnance to the
clearest dictates of my understanding and judgment, of
what is right and fit.</p>

<p>I cannot excuse myself from adding, that most of the
arms, ammunition, and clothing for the army, have been
contracted for here, by the Ministers of Congress, and paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
for, or agreed to be paid for here, in silver and gold.
Very little of these articles have been shipped by private
adventurers. They have much more commonly shipped
articles of luxury, of which the country did not stand in
need, and upon which they must have made vast profits.</p>

<p>Thus have I communicated to your Excellency my
sentiments, with that freedom, which becomes a citizen of
the United States, intrusted by the public with some of its
interests. I intreat your Excellency to consider them as
springing from no other motive, than a strong attachment
to the union of the States, and a desire to prevent all unnecessary
causes of parties and disputes; and from a
desire not only to preserve the alliance in all its vigor, but
to prevent everything, which may unnecessarily oppose itself
to the affection and confidence between the two nations,
which I wish to see increased every day; as every day
convinces me more and more of the necessity, that France
and America will be under, of cherishing their mutual
connexions.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 22d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have this day the honor of a letter from his Excellency
the Count de Vergennes, on the subject of the resolutions
of Congress, of the 18th of March, concerning the
paper bills, in which his Excellency informs me, that the
Chevalier de la Luzerne has orders to make the strongest
representations upon the subject. I am not certain whether
his Excellency means, that such orders were sent so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
ago as to have reached the hand of the Minister at Congress,
or whether they have been lately expected. If the latter, I
submit to your Excellency, whether it would not be expedient
to request, that those orders may be stopped until
proper representations can be made at Court, to the end,
that if it can be made to appear, as I firmly believe that it
may, that those orders were given upon misinformation,
they may be revoked, otherwise sent on.</p>

<p>Your Excellency will excuse this, because it appears to
me a matter of very great importance. The affair of our
paper is sufficiently dangerous and critical, and if a representation
from his Majesty should be made, advantages will
not fail to be taken of it by the tories, and by interested
and disappointed speculators, who may spread an alarm
among many uninformed people, so as to endanger the
public peace.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 26th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The resolutions of Congress, of the 18th of March,
respecting the paper bills, appeared first in Europe, as recited
in the act of the Assembly of Pennsylvania; they
were next published in the English newspapers, as taken
from a Boston paper published by the Council; at last the
resolutions appeared in the Journals of Congress.</p>

<p>A great clamor was raised, and spread, that the United
States had violated their faith, and had declared themselves
bankrupts, unable to pay more than two and a half per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
cent. A gentleman soon after called on me, and told me,
that the Court was alarmed, and that the Count de Vergennes
would be glad to consult me upon the subject. I
then received a letter from Boston, acquainting me, that the
Legislature of Massachusetts had adopted the plan. Of
this letter I sent an extract immediately to the Count, and
waited on him at Versailles, where I had the honor of a
long conversation with his Excellency on the subject. He
desired me to converse with his first Secretary, which I
did particularly.</p>

<p>His Excellency told me he had written to me on the
subject, and that I should receive the letter the next day.
On my return from Versailles, I received a letter from Mr
Gerry, informing me of the resolutions to pay the Loan
Office certificates, at the value of money at the time when
they were issued. I had before told the Count, that I was
persuaded this was a part of the plan. I sent an extract of
this letter also to the Count, without loss of time. The
next day I received the letter from his Excellency, the
copy of which, and of my answer, are enclosed. Yesterday,
Mr Trumbull of Connecticut, favored me with a law
of the State, respecting this matter, and an estimate of the
gradual progress of depreciation. These papers I forthwith
transmitted to his Excellency. I am determined to
give my sentiments to his Majesty's Ministers whenever
they shall see cause to ask them, although it is not within
my department, until I shall be forbidden by Congress;
and to this end I shall go to Court often enough to give
them an opportunity to ask them, if they wish to know
them.</p>

<p>The clamor that has been raised, has been so industriously
spread, that I cannot but suspect, that the motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
at bottom has either been a wish to have an opportunity
of continuing the profitable speculations, which artful
men are able to make in a depreciating currency, or else
by spreading a diffidence in American credit, to discourage
many from engaging in American trade, that the profits of
it may still continue to be confined to a few.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 29th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The disputes about the Alliance, have been so critical
and disagreeable, that Congress will pardon me for making
a few observations upon our arrangements here.</p>

<p>I apprehend, that many of the disputes, delays, and
other inconveniences, that have attended our affairs in this
kingdom, have arisen from blending the offices of political
Minister, Board of Admiralty, Chamber of Commerce, and
Commercial Agent together. The business of the Minister
is to negotiate with the Court, to propose and consult upon
plans for the conduct of the war, to collect and transmit
intelligence from other parts, especially concerning the
designs and the forces of the enemy. This is business
enough for the wisest and most industrious man the United
States have in their service, aided by an active, intelligent,
and laborious secretary. But added to all this, our Ministers
at the Court of Versailles, have ever been overloaded
with commercial and Admiralty business, complicated and
perplexed in its nature, and endless in its details. But for
this, I am persuaded much more might have been done in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the conduct of the war, and the United States might have
had more effectual assistance, and France and Spain too
fewer misfortunes to bewail.</p>

<p>I would, therefore, beg leave to propose, to appoint a
consul without loss of time to reside at Nantes, and to him
consign all vessels from the United States. I think it
should be an American, some merchant of known character,
abilities, and industry, who would consent to serve his
country for moderate emoluments. Such persons are to
be found in great numbers in the United States. There
are many applications from French gentlemen. But I
think that a want of knowledge of our language, our laws,
customs, and even the humors of our people, for even
these must be considered, would prevent them from giving
satisfaction, or doing justice. Besides, if it is an honor, a
profit, or only an opportunity to travel and see the world
for improvement, I think the native Americans have a
right to expect it; and further, that the public have a right
to expect that whatever advantages are honestly to be
made in this way, should return sometime or other to
America; together with the knowledge and experience
gained at the same time.</p>

<p>These consuls, as well as the foreign Ministers, should
all be instructed to transmit to Congress, written accounts
of the civil and military constitutions of the places where
they are, as well as all the advantages for commerce with
the whole world, especially with the United States. These
letters preserved, will be a repository of political and commercial
knowledge, that in future times may be a rich
treasure to the United States. To these consuls, the commercial
concerns of the public should be committed, and
the vessels of war. It will be necessary sometimes to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a frigate to Europe to bring intelligence, to bring passengers,
even, perhaps, to bring commodities, or fetch stores.
But I hope no frigate will ever again be sent to cruise, or
be put under the command of anybody in Europe, consul
or Minister. They may receive their orders from the
Navy Board in America, and be obliged to obey them. I
have had a great deal of experience in the government of
these frigates, when I had the honor to be one of the Ministers
Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles, and afterwards
at Nantes, L'Orient, and Brest, when I was seeking
a passage home. Disputes were perpetually arising between
officers and their crews, between captains and their
officers, and between the officers of one ship and another.
There were never officers enough to compose a court martial,
and nobody had authority to remove or suspend officers
without their consent; so that in short, there was little
order, discipline, subordination, or decency.</p>

<p>Another thing, when frigates are under the direction of
an authority at a distance of three or four hundred miles,
so much time is lost in writing and sending letters and
waiting for answers, it has been found an intolerable embarrassment
to the service. It is now two years since
consuls were expected, and a secretary to this mission.
It is a great misfortune to the United States that they have
not arrived. Every man can see that it has been a great
misfortune, but none can tell how great. There is much
reason to believe, that if our establishments here had been
upon a well digested plan and completed, and if our affairs
had been urged with as much skill and industry as they
might in that case have been, that we should at this moment
have been blessed with peace, or at least with tranquillity
and security, which would have resulted from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
total expulsion of the English from the United States and
the West India Islands.</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose a copy of a letter of the
Count de Vergennes to me, of the 21st of this month, and
a copy of my answer to his Excellency, of the 22d.</p>

<p>This correspondence is upon a subject that has lain
much out of the way of my particular pursuits, and, therefore,
I may be inaccurate in some things; but, in the
principles, I am well persuaded I am right. I hope that
things are explained so as to be intelligible, and that there
is nothing inconsistent with that decency, which ought in
such a case to be observed.</p>

<p>If your Excellency thinks me materially wrong in anything,
I should be much obliged to you to point it out to
me, for I am open to conviction.</p>

<p>This affair, in America, is a very tender and dangerous
business, and requires all the address, as well as all the
firmness of Congress, to extricate the country out of the
embarrassment arising from it; and there is no possible
system, I believe, that could give universal satisfaction to
all; but this appears to me, to promise to give more general
satisfaction, than any other that I have ever heard suggested.
I have added copies of the whole correspondence.</p>

<h3>COUNT DE VERGENNES TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p class="head">
Versailles, June 30th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you did me the honor
to write me on the 22d inst. on the subject of the resolution
of Congress of the 18th of March last. I have already
informed you, that it was by no means my intention to analyse
this resolution, as it respects the citizens of the United
States, nor examine whether circumstances authorise the
arrangement or not. I had but one object in writing to
you with the confidence I thought due to your knowledge
and your attachment to the alliance, which was to convince
you that the French ought not to be confounded with the
Americans, and that there would be a manifest injustice in
making them sustain the loss with which they are threatened.</p>

<p>The details into which you have thought proper to enter
have not changed my sentiments; but I think that all further
discussion on this subject will be needless, and I shall only
observe, that if the King's Council considers, as you pretend,
the resolution of Congress in a wrong point of view,
the Chevalier de la Luzerne, who is on the spot, will not fail
to elucidate the matter; and if Congress on their part shall
not adopt the representations, which that Minister is charged
to make to them, they will undoubtedly communicate to us
their reasons to justify their refusal.</p>

<p>Should they be well founded the King will take them
into consideration, his Majesty demanding nothing but the
most exact justice. But should they be otherwise, he will
renew his instances to the United States, and will confidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
expect from their penetration and wisdom a decision
conformable to his demand. His Majesty is the more
persuaded that Congress will give their whole attention to
this business, as this Assembly, which has frequently renewed
the assurance, values, as well as yourself, Sir, the
union which subsists between France and the United States,
and that they will assuredly perceive that the French
deserve a preference before other nations, who have no
treaty with America, and who even have not, as yet, acknowledged
her Independence.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 1st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I had this morning the honor of your letter of the 30th
of June.</p>

<p>It is very certain, that the representations from his Majesty,
which may be made by his Minister, the Chevalier
de la Luzerne, will be attended to by Congress with all
possible respect; and its due weight will be given to every
fact and argument, that he may adduce; and I am well
persuaded, that Congress will be able to give such reasons
for their final result, as will give entire satisfaction to his
Majesty, and remove every color of just complaint from his
subjects.</p>

<p>As in my letter of the 22d of last month, I urged such
reasons as appeared to me incontestible, to show that the
resolution of Congress of the 18th of March, connected
with the other resolution, to pay the loan office certificates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
according to the value of money at the time they were
emitted, being a determination to pay the full value of all
the bills and certificates, which were out; and the depreciation
of both being more the act and fault of their possessors
than of government, was neither a violation of the
public faith, nor an act of bankruptcy. I have the honor
to agree with your Excellency in opinion, that any further
discussion of these questions is unnecessary.</p>

Paris, July 6th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>In looking over the long list of vessels belonging to the
United States, taken and destroyed, and recollecting the
whole history of the rise and progress of our navy, it is
very difficult to avoid tears. Nevertheless, what we have
done and lost, shows what we can do. Our resources of
materials, artists, and seamen, are not exhausted. But it is
impossible not to inquire, whether we have not committed
errors in the destination of our vessels? Whether our navy
is equal to the attack or defence of places? Whether our
articles of war for the government of the marine, are adequate
to the introduction of that obedience and discipline
that are necessary? Whether cruising for the protection
of our own trade, against the depredations of privateers
and smaller vessels of war of our enemies, and for the
purpose of making prizes of transports and merchant ships,
is not the object fittest in the present stage of our naval
history, to encourage seamen to engage in our service, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
form officers, to supply the United States with many things,
and to weaken and distress our foes? Officers who have
a thirst for glory, and wish to distinguish themselves by
brilliant battles, ought not to be discouraged, but I cannot
but think, that at this period they would do more essential
service to their country, by a line of conduct leading to
fewer laurels, but more wealth.</p>

<p>In all events, however, it is to be hoped and presumed,
that Congress will give great attention to their navy, to the
augmentation of ships, the multiplication of seamen, the
improvement of discipline, and the formation of officers.
Americans, I see, must cherish their own navy. I fear
that no other nation would grieve very much at the total
destruction of it, before the conclusion of a peace. I am
sorry to say this; but I have heard such hints as convince
me, that it is my duty to put Congress on their guard, and
to entreat them to leave nothing unattempted to put their
marine upon the best footing in their power.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 7th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>On the 27th of June Mr Hartley, after a speech of an
hour long, moved, that the House would give him leave to
bring in a bill, to the end to empower the Court, to adopt
the most proper means to make peace with America.
After a short debate, the question being put, the majority
was for the negative. This motion is said to have had the
less success, because it is founded on a principle absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
false and derogatory to the royal prerogative. The
King of England, to make peace, wants nothing but the
will. It is in this case only that he is absolute. The
American war was commenced without the participation
of Parliament. Why should they give the King new powers
to bring it to a conclusion? There is but one means
of forcing him to it, and that is by refusing him the necessary
subsidies; and they are now further from this than
ever. But it is ridiculous to labor to clothe the King with
powers, which are inherent in his title. It is, in other words,
to permit him to be a King.</p>

<p>The bill is of the following tenor. "Whereas for some
years there have arisen unfortunate disputes between Great
Britain and several Provinces of North America, which
have occasioned the calamities of war; to the end to prevent
a greater effusion of blood, and to re-establish peace,
be it enacted, that his Majesty be permitted by virtue of
letters patent, to nominate Commissioners with power to
treat, consult, and agree upon the means of restoring peace,
in concert with persons authorised for this purpose by the
said Provinces of North America. That, to facilitate the
good intentions of this bill, be it enacted, that the King
give power to the said Commissioners, to cause to be suspended
all hostilities by land and by sea, for so long a time
and under such conditions and restrictions as they shall
judge proper. That, to the end to establish upon a good
foundation, a cordial reconciliation and a durable peace
between Great Britain and the said Provinces, by reinstating
them in their ancient friendship, his Majesty may
legally permit his said Commissioners to grant and to ratify,
from time to time, any article of pacification, which
thus granted and ratified, shall have its full and entire effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
for ten years, to be dated from the 1st of August of the
present year. That, for removing every obstacle, which
may oppose itself, to the full execution of any article of
pacification, his Majesty shall be at liberty, by any order in
writing, signed with his hand and countersigned by one or
more Secretaries of State, to authorise the said Commissioners
to suspend, during ten years, to be dated from the
1st of August of the present year, the execution of any act
of Parliament, which concerns the said Provinces, so far
as the said acts, their clauses or conditions, may put any
obstacle to the full effect, and to the execution of any article
of pacification between Great Britain and the said Provinces.
That, to the end to establish a durable reconciliation,
and a perpetual peace between Great Britain and the
said Provinces, be it enacted, that all and every article of
pacification, resolved and ratified for ten years as aforesaid,
shall be from time to time communicated to both Houses
of Parliament, to be by them examined, as forming the
base of a sincere and durable union; and that every one of
the said articles having been once approved in Parliament,
shall have forever its full and entire effect. That the
present act shall remain in force until the 31st of December."</p>

<p>Having been disappointed, by another accident, of my
English papers, I have been obliged to translate this bill
from the Courier de l'Europe, I hope to transmit the original
in a few days. It is however of so little consequence,
that it is scarce worth transcribing. Other grounds must
be taken than that of General Conway, Governor Pownal,
or Mr Hartley, before anything will be done in earnest
towards peace. The history of Charleston, and the numberless
fictions with which the stockjobbers have decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
it, have raised the stocks three and a half per cent, and
have given such a temporary intoxication to the people,
that scarce anything is talked of but unconditional submission.</p>

<p>The affair of Mobile, the dispersion of both the outward
and homeward bound Quebec fleet, the indecisive battles
between de Guichen and Rodney, and the anxiety for Walsingham's
fleet, and twenty other fears, begin now to sink
their spirits again.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 7th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 21st of last month, the merchants of the city of
Amsterdam arrived at the Hague, and presented to their
High Mightinesses a petition, conceived in these terms.</p>

<p>"To their High Mightinesses, our Lords, the States-General
of the United Provinces.</p>

<p>"The subscribers, all merchants, trading to the West
Indies, and established under the jurisdiction of this State,
give respectfully to understand, that, to their great regret,
the petitioners have learned, by the way of a ship, lately
arrived from Curaçoa, the unheard of ill treatment exercised
by the English in taking the barques belonging to the
subjects of their High Mightinesses, which trade with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
French possessions in the said countries, and which, loaded
with the productions of the said countries, purchased or
consigned, make sail to return to the islands or places
which belong to the dominions of their High Mightinesses,
without having even to this time, that your petitioners
know of, returned either the barques or cargoes; but so
far from it, that the cargoes of some of them have been
already condemned, and the barques restored empty; a
fate which the petitioners fear to see others undergo likewise.
And as by these vexations and unparalleled ill treatment,
the subjects of your High Mightinesses, contrary to
all kinds of right, are deprived of their property and effects
embarked, as well as of the liberty which is assured to
them by the treaties subsisting between the Crown of England
and this State, and by these means see themselves
reduced to an impossibility of being able to procure for the
ships sent from home to the West Indies, the cargoes necessary
for their return, all expeditions and adventures of
merchandises from our countries to these places must absolutely
cease, and draw after it the inevitable ruin of this
branch of commerce, so important as well as that of many
of the subjects of your High Mightinesses, both in this
country and in the West Indies."</p>

<p>"For these causes, the petitioners pray, in all humility,
that your High Mightinesses would be pleased to take this
navigation and commerce, forming an object so considerable,
under your effectual protection, in the first place, by
granting the necessary convoy to ships which go to the
West Indies, or which return from thence, and in the next
place, to order to cruise in those seas a sufficient number
of vessels of war, or even to order them to escort the
barques in question, and other trading ships, loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
productions and effects permitted by the treaties, and
making sail for the French Colonies, or returning from
them, to the end to secure them from all further insult;
which will preserve at the same time the petitioners, as
well as many other subjects of the Republic from total
ruin. That it may, moreover, please your High Mightinesses
to charge the Count de Welderen, your Envoy Extraordinary
to the British Court, to make the necessary
representations touching the seizure of these barques, to
seek to obtain of the English Ministry, that the requisite
orders may be sent to the Colonies of his Britannic Majesty,
for releasing the aforesaid barques with their cargoes,
paying, at the same time, the expenses occasioned by
their seizure; in fine, that by the good and efficacious
offices of his Excellency, things may be directed in such a
manner, that on the part of the Court of St James, they
may write to Jamaica and elsewhere, and not interrupt for
the future, the subjects of their High Mightinesses in the
exercise of this lawful commerce, but to permit them to
enjoy a free navigation and commerce, such as have been
solemnly accorded and guaranteed to them by the treaty
of 1674."</p>

</p>

<p>I received the letter your Excellency did me the honor
of writing to me, dated June 30th, together with the
papers accompanying it, containing the correspondence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Mr Adams.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I have taken some pains to understand the
subject, and obtain information of facts from persons recently
arrived, having received no letters myself that explain
it. I cannot say, that I yet perfectly understand it,
but in this I am clear, that if the operation directed by
Congress in their resolution of March the 18th occasions,
from the necessity of the case, some inequality of justice,
that inconvenience ought to fall wholly on the inhabitants
of the States, who reap with it the advantages obtained
by the measure; and that the greatest care should be
taken that foreign merchants, particularly the French, who
are our creditors, do not suffer by it. This I am so confident
the Congress will do, that I do not think any representations
of mine necessary to persuade them to it.</p>

<p>I shall not fail, however, to lay the whole before them;
and I beg that the King may be assured that their sentiments,
and those of the Americans in general, with regard
to the alliance, as far as I have been able to learn them,
not only from private letters but from authentic public
facts, differ widely from those that seem to be expressed
by Mr Adams in his letter to your Excellency, and are
filled with the strongest impressions of the friendship of
France, of the generous manner in which his Majesty was
pleased to enter into an equal treaty with us, and of the
great obligations our country is under for the important
aids he has since afforded us.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 13th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>By the treaty of alliance of the 6th of February, 1778,
his Majesty and the United States agreed, in case of war,
to join their councils and efforts against the enterprises of
the common enemy; to make it a common cause, and aid
each other mutually with their good offices, their councils,
and their forces, according to the exigencies of conjunctures;
and each of the contracting parties, in the manner it
may judge most proper, is to make all the efforts in its
power against the common enemy.</p>

<p>I have cited these clauses from the treaty, not as foundations
of any demand that I have to make, because they
are neither proper to support any demand, nor have I authority
to make any if they were, but as an apology for the
liberty I take of requesting your Excellency's attention to
a few observations upon the present conjuncture of affairs.</p>

<p>It is certain, from the best intelligence from London, as
well as from the debates in Parliament, on the several motions
which have been made for a pacification, that the
British Ministry are inflexibly determined to pursue the
war another campaign in America, to send more troops
and ships there, if they possibly can obtain them, and to
put to the hazard not only the national credit, but their
maritime power, and even their political existence, rather
than give up their designs of domination over America;
and indeed this is not at all to be wondered at, that the
Ministers and the nation, who have so far lost their justice,
their humanity, and policy, as to deliberately form and
pursue the plan of changing the foundations of the laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and governments of thirteen Colonies, and reducing them
to slavery, and who have pursued this object with such
sanguinary fury for so many years, should persist so as to
bury themselves in the ruins of their empire, rather than to
fail of their purpose, when it is plain they consider, and
that not without reason, the same ruin in the independence
of America, and her connexion with France.</p>

<p>The conduct of Count de Guichen, on the 17th of
April, and the 15th and 19th of May, in the West Indies,
does great honor to the national bravery, as well as to
their science in naval tactics, and shows that there is no
cause to fear that the enemy will obtain any advantage
there. Yet nothing has yet been done on either side that
seems decisive.</p>

<p>The advantages, which Spain has gained in West Florida,
and particularly of late at Mobile, and the probability
that she will succeed in gaining both the Floridas, show
that the English are on the losing hand in that quarter; but
it is not the loss of both the Floridas, nor of all the West
India Islands, in my opinion, that will induce them to make
peace, and acknowledge the independence of America in
alliance with France. They will see every possession
they have beyond the island lopped off, one after another,
before they will do this.</p>

<p>I pretend not to know, to what part of America M. de
Ternay and M. de Rochambeau are destined, but to whatever
part it is, whether Canada, Nova Scotia, New York,
Carolina, or Georgia, I have no hopes of anything decisive
from their operations, although they should be instructed
to co-operate with General Washington. If they
should be destined against Canada or Nova Scotia, they
may succeed; but this success will not be decisive. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
they are intended against New York, I have no hopes of
their success. The naval force is not sufficient to command
the seas. Admiral Graves, added to the ships
before at New York, will be superior; and I shall venture
to give my opinion, that without a superiority of naval
force, clear and indisputable, New York will never be
taken. It is so situated, so fortified, it is garrisoned with
troops so accustomed to war, and so embittered and inflamed
by cruel passions, carefully nursed up in their
breasts by their King and their Generals, and it is universally
regarded by them a port of such essential importance,
that I confess I should despair of success against it, with an
army twice as numerous as that of the Generals Washington
and Rochambeau united, while the English are masters
of the seas, or even while they have there an equality of
naval power.</p>

<p>Most people in Europe have wondered at the inactivity
of the American army, for these two years past; but it is
merely from want of knowledge and attention. The true
cause of it is, the English have confined themselves to their
strong holds in seaport towns, and have been sheltered
from all attacks and insults by the guns of their men-of-war,
and forever will be so, while they have the superiority
at sea. If our army had been three times as numerous as
it was, it must have remained inactive, without a fleet to
co-operate with it; for an attack upon New York without
a fleet, would have been only sacrificing the lives of thousands
of brave men, without a possibility of succeeding.</p>

<p>Had the English two years ago marched into the country
from Philadelphia, instead of retreating back with precipitation
to New York, Europe would have heard more
of the exertions of the American army, so much more, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in my serious opinion, you would have heard of their total
destruction. As it was, they were closely pursued, attacked,
and if not beaten, they had much the worst of the action,
for besides their loss in killed and wounded, and in
those who perished under the fatigue and heat of the day,
not less than five hundred deserted from them, and their
desertions would have been multiplied in every unsuccessful
engagement within the country.</p>

<p>If in the last year the British army had marched out
into the country, instead of remaining under cover of their
men-of-war, I am equally clear, that they would have been
ruined. The English, ever since the alliance, have been
fearfully apprehensive of an attack upon their strong holds
upon the coast by the French. This it was that induced
them to retreat from Philadelphia to New York, and this
has kept them almost wholly confined to that garrison the
last year. I mention this, merely to wipe off the imputations
said to result from the inactivity of our army, since
the alliance, by showing the true cause of it, that it proceeds
not from any change of sentiments in the Americans,
but from the change of the mode of prosecuting the war
on the part of our enemies.</p>

<p>I am, however, clearly of opinion, and I know it to be
the general sense of America, that the English, both in
North America and in the West India Islands, have been
for these two years past absolutely in the power of their
enemies; and that they are so now, and will continue to be
so, in such a degree, that nothing will be wanting but attention
to their situation, and a judicious application of the
forces of the allies to accomplish the entire reduction of
their power in America. In order to show this, let me
beg your Excellency's attention to a few remarks upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
situation of the English, and upon the method of applying
the force of the allies so as to reduce them.</p>

<p>The English are in possession of Canada, a province
vastly extensive, and in which there is a great number of
ports, at a great distance from each other, necessary to be
maintained among a people too, who are by no means attached
to them, but who would readily afford all the assistance
in their power to the united forces of France and
the United States, and who would join them in considerable
numbers. In this whole province, the English have
not, comprehending the garrisons of all their ports, more
than four thousand men.</p>

<p>The English are in possession of Nova Scotia; they
have in Halifax and the other parts of the province, and at
Penobscot, about three thousand men. But the people of
this province being descendants and emigrants from New
England, chiefly, are discontented with the British government,
and desirous of joining the United States. They
are in possession of New York Island, Staten Island, and
Long Island, where they have in all of regular British
troops, &mdash;&mdash; thousand men. The militia, volunteers, &amp;c.
of whom they make such an ostentatious display in the
despatches of their Generals, and in the gazette of St
James, are of very little consideration; their numbers are
much exaggerated; it is force, fear, and policy, that enrol
the greater part of them; there are perhaps fifteen thousand
inhabitants of the city. These, together with the army
and navy, are fed and supplied with provisions, and stores,
and fuel, and their cattle and horses with forage, brought
by sea from Quebec, Halifax, Ireland, and the West Indies,
except the small quantity, which they draw from
Long Island and Staten Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>They are now in possession of Charleston, in South
Carolina, and Savannah, in Georgia. Their armies and
navies in these places, as well as the inhabitants, must be
chiefly supplied by sea in the same manner. They are
still perhaps in possession of St Augustine, in East Florida,
and Pensacola, in the west. From these places, they
have drawn of late years great supplies of lumber and
provisions for their West India Islands. The number of
troops in Georgia and Carolina may amount to &mdash;&mdash; thousands.
They are in possession of Jamaica, Barbadoes,
Antigua, St Christophers, and St Lucia, and other islands.
These draw supplies of provisions and lumber, &amp;c. from
Quebec, Halifax, Pensacola, and Augustine, that is from
the Floridas. The number of troops they have in each
island, I am not able to ascertain; but certainly they are
not strong in any of them; and the climate in the West
Indies, and in Georgia and Carolina, is making a rapid
consumption of their men.</p>

<p>From this sketch, it will be easily seen, what a great
number of posts they have to sustain; how these are mutually
connected with, and dependent on each other, and
that their existence in all of them depends upon their superiority
at sea, and that to carry on the intercourse and
communication between these various places, a vast number
of transports, provision vessels and merchant ships are
necessary. This is so much the fact, that the English nation
has now little navigation left, but what is employed in
maintaining the communication of these places with one
another and with Europe. Here then it is, that the English
commerce and navy is vulnerable; and this it is, which
clearly points out to their enemies the only sure and certain
way of reducing their power in that quarter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
world; and if it is reduced there, it is brought into a narrow
compass everywhere.</p>

<p>The policy and necessity of keeping always a superior
fleet both in the West India Islands and on the coast of the
continent of North America, is from all this very obvious.
The English are so sensible of this, that they dread it
as the greatest evil that can befall them. The appearance
of the Count d'Estaing upon the coast of North America,
never failed to throw the English into the utmost terror
and consternation.</p>

<p>The appearance of a French fleet upon our coasts has
repeatedly compelled, and ever must compel, the English
to call off from their cruises all their frigates and other
ships, and to assemble them at New York, for their security
and the defence of that place. These are among the happy
effects of such a measure, the communication of the United
States not only with each other but with the West Indies,
with France, and all other parts of Europe, with which
they have any concern, is immediately opened, and they
are thereby easily furnished, in all parts, with everything
fitting and necessary to carry on the war with the greatest
vigor. His Majesty's fleets and armies will be amply and
much more cheaply supplied, and his subjects will reap, in
common with the inhabitants of the United States, the
benefits of this free commerce. It will give free sea-room
to the few frigates belonging to Congress and the several
States to cruise for the merchant ships, provision vessels,
and transports of the enemy. It gives opportunity also to
the privateers to do the same. There are at this day,
notwithstanding the dreadful sacrifices made at Charleston
and Penobscot, sacrifices, the necessity of which would
have been entirely prevented by a few ships of the line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the Continental frigates, the Confederacy, which is arrived
at Philadelphia, the Alliance which will soon be there, the
Trumbull, the Deane, the Bourbon, and also a ship of fiftysix
guns which is nearly ready for sea. The State of
Massachusetts has two frigates and smaller vessels. There
are besides these, now in being, belonging to Newburyport,
Beverly, Salem, Marblehead, Portsmouth, Boston and
Rhode Island, about forty privateers. There are several
belonging to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>If a French fleet should constantly remain upon that
coast, the number of these privateers would be doubled in
a very few months. What havoc then must these armed
vessels make, especially if a few French frigates should be
also ordered to cruise for prizes among the provision
vessels, merchant ships, and transports, passing and repassing
to and from America and the West India Islands to
Europe, and to and from America and the West Indies,
and to and from Quebec, Nova Scotia, New York,
Charleston, Savannah, and the Floridas. Such depredations
have several times been made by our cruisers alone,
as to reduce the English at New York to very great distress,
and it would be very easy in this way to reduce them to
such misery as to oblige them to surrender at discretion.</p>

<p>I therefore beg leave to submit it to your Excellency's
consideration, whether there is any possible way that a
marine force can be employed against the English, so
much to the advantage of France and the disadvantage of
England, as in this way, and whether upon the principles
of French interest and policy alone, even without taking into
consideration that of the United States, a fleet ought not
to be constantly kept in North America. The advantages
they will there have in artists, supplies, accommodations,
&amp;c. above the English, are obvious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>But the question will arise, where shall they winter? I
answer, they can winter with perfect security and advantage,
either at Boston, Rhode Island, Delaware, or Chesapeake
Bays.</p>

<p>Another question will arise, whether they should all winter
together in one port, or be separated to several ports?
I apprehend, however, that it would be most prudent to
leave it to the discretion of the commander-in-chief of the
squadron, to keep the squadron together, or to detach
parts of it, according to the exigencies of the service, advising
with Congress, or with the Chevalier de la Luzerne,
from time to time.</p>

<p>Two ships of the line, with three frigates, stationed at
Boston, with orders to cruise occasionally for the protection
of French and American trade, and the annoyance of
the enemy, the same number at Rhode Island with the
same orders, the same number at Delaware river, with
similar orders, and a like number in Chesapeake bay, with
like orders, which would make eight ships of the line and
twelve frigates, I have a moral certainty would, in one
year, reduce the power of the English in North America,
to absolute annihilation, without striking a blow on land.
These ships would make a diversion of an equal force of
the English, from the West India Islands, so that they
would be in that respect as usefully employed for his Majesty
there as anywhere. Eight ships of the line, and
twelve frigates, stationed together at Rhode Island, with
orders to cruise for the same purposes, would do the same
thing.</p>

<p>Which plan would do best, I dare not undertake to say,
but until further informed and instructed by Congress I
should think however that the best plan would be to station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the fleet for the winter, either in Delaware or Chesapeake
Bay; and as the war has lately turned to the southward,
I am inclined to think that Chesapeake Bay would be the
most proper.</p>

<p>But in all events, I beg leave to entreat in the most
earnest manner, that a powerful fleet may be ordered to
winter somewhere in North America. By this means
I think there is a moral certainty, the English will be
ruined there, whereas if dependence is had upon the assault
and attack of their strong holds, without the most
absolute command of the sea, I fear it will end in disappointment
and disgrace.</p>

<p>There is the more urgent reasons for laying these considerations
before your Excellency, because there is a
portion of the people in America who wish to return to the
domination of Great Britain, many of whom are artful and
sensible men. They take notice of every circumstance of
the conduct of France, and represent it in such a light as
they think will throw a prejudice against the alliance into
the minds of the people. They represent the affair of
Rhode Island and of Savannah, and of some other things,
as proofs that the Court of France do not mean to give
any effectual aid to America, but only to play off her
strength against that of Britain, and thus exhaust both.
The refugees in England concur with them in these representations,
and the Ministry and the members of Parliament
in their public speeches represent the same thing.</p>

<p>Even Mr Hartley, who is more for peace than any man
in that kingdom, in a printed letter to the inhabitants of the
county of York, says, "It is our duty to unravel by negotiation,
the combination of powers now acting against us;"
and he says further, in express words, that "It is apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to all the world, that France might long ago have put an
end to that part of the war, which has been most distressing
to America, if they had chosen so to do." He must
mean here the war of their frigates and privateers upon our
trade. "Let the whole system of France be considered,"
says he, "from the beginning down to the late retreat from
Savannah, and I think it is impossible to put any other construction
upon it but this, viz. that it has always been the
deliberate intention and object of France, for purposes of
their own, to encourage the continuation of the war in
America, in hopes of exhausting the strength and resources
of this country, and of depressing the rising power of
America." This is not only the language of Mr Hartley,
but the general language of newspapers and pamphlets, and,
I am well informed, of conversation in England. These
are very industriously sent to America, through various
channels, which cannot be stopped by laws, art, or power.</p>

<p>The body of the people have great confidence in the
sincerity of France; but if these contrary opinions should
be suffered to gain ground, as they most assuredly will if
something is not done to prevent it, when all the world sees
and declares as they do, that it is the best policy of France,
if she considered her own interest alone in the conduct of
the war, to keep a superior naval force upon the coast of
the continent of North America, I leave your Excellency to
judge what a melancholy effect it will have upon our affairs.
There is no event, in my opinion, which would have so
direct a tendency to give force and extent to opinions so
dangerous to both nations, as the calling off from the continent
your naval force, during the winter, and not keeping
a superiority there through the year. I scruple not to
give it as my opinion, that it will disunite, weaken, and distress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
us more than we should have been, disunited, weakened,
or distressed, if the alliance had never been made.</p>

<p>The United States of America are a great and powerful
people, whatever European statesmen may think of them.
If we take into our estimate the numbers and the characters
of her people, the extent, variety, and fertility of her
soil, her commerce, and her skill, and materials for shipbuilding,
and her seamen, excepting France, Spain, England,
Germany, and Russia, there is not a state in Europe
so powerful. Breaking off such a nation as this from the
English so suddenly, and uniting it so closely with France,
is one of the most extraordinary events that ever happened
among mankind. The prejudices of nations in
favor of themselves, and against all other nations, which
spring from self-love, and are often nurtured by policy for
unworthy purposes, and which have been ever certainly
cultivated by the English with the utmost care in the minds
of the Americans, as well as of the people of every other
part of their dominions, certainly deserve the attention of the
wisest statesmen, and as they are not to be eradicated in a
moment, they require to be managed with some delicacy.</p>

<p>It is too often said in France, where the prejudice
against the English has not been fostered into so much
rancor, because France never had so much to fear from
England, as England has from France, "That the Americans
and the English are the same thing," not to make
it appear, that there are some remnants of prejudices
against the Americans among the French, and it must be
confessed there are some in America against France. It
is really astonishing, however, that there are so few, and it
is the interest and duty of both to lessen them as fast as
possible, and to avoid with the nicest care, every colorable
cause of reviving any part of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>I beg your Excellency to excuse this trouble, because
the state of things in North America has really become
alarming, and this merely for the want of a few French
men-of-war upon that coast.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>The advices from the Hague of the 9th of this month
are, that the talk had been of a Congress to be held in
that place; but as her Majesty, the Empress of Russia,
had given to understand, that she desired that the conferences
should be held at Petersburg, the States-General
have consequently named, upon the proposition of his
Serene Highness, the Prince Stadtholder, the Baron de
Waassenaar Starrenburg, and the Baron Van Heckeren de
Brantzenburg, Deputies to the Assembly of their High
Mightinesses, on the part of the Provinces of Holland,
West Friesland, and Utrecht, Ministers Plenipotentiaries to
go to Petersburg, to the end to assist there at the conferences,
which are to be held for the protection of the commerce
of neutrals.</p>

<p>And that the Chevalier Llano, now Minister Plenipotentiary
of his Catholic Majesty to their High Mightinesses,
had arrived at that residence.</p>

<p>The English continue to fill all the newspapers of Europe
with the despatches of Clinton, Cornwallis, Tarleton,
&amp;c. of their triumphant progress in Carolina, and we are
unable to obtain a syllable from any part of America to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
contradict it, or explain it. It is devoutly to be wished,
that Congress would appoint some active and intelligent
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and make it his duty to
transmit the journals, newspapers, and other intelligence,
and duplicates and triplicates of them, to their servants
abroad. Vessel after vessel arrives, even directly from
Philadelphia, and we cannot get the journals, papers, and
scarcely a private letter by them. Surely, the department
of foreign affairs is of some importance to the United
States, and their most important officers abroad ought not
to be less informed, than every private merchant. The
successes of the English in Carolina have filled them with
the most ridiculous exultations. They have thrown off the
mask entirely, and talk now almost universally of nothing
but unconditional submission; not an idea of peace is entertained.
They are perfectly confident the Congress will
not maintain their authority three months. They have
filled the world with histories of insurrections at Philadelphia,
which drove the Congress to Lancaster, killed the
French Minister, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The stocks rose three
and threefourths per cent. This is the wise nation, that
is to govern America, as they think, at their pleasure.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 15th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The news from Petersburg of the 13th of June is, that
the last advices received from Mohilew have confirmed the
news, that the Empress would return sooner than was at
first expected, and that the Emperor, under the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the Count de Falckenstein, would arrive at the same time,
at Petersburg. That the fleet of Cronstadt had been
eight or ten days in the road, waiting only for their final
instructions to put to sea. It will be separated into three
divisions, each of five ships of the line, under the command
of the Rear Admirals Barisson, Cruse, and Polibin.
Since the departure of a courier, which Mr Harris, the
British Envoy, has expedited to his Court, the 26th of
last month, a report has been spread, that he has demanded
his recall.</p>

<p>The ordinance, which the Empress has passed at
Czarsko-Zelo, on the 19th of May, to the end to ascertain
the rights and duties of her subjects relative to the neutrality,
is too remarkable, in the present conjuncture, not to
be given entire to the public. The following is the preamble.</p>

<p>"The maritime war, subsisting for some time between
Great Britain, on the one part, and France and Spain on
the other, has begun lately to do equal injury to the commerce
and the navigation of our faithful subjects. We
have not in consequence failed to employ for their protection
and indemnification from all the losses, which have
been occasioned to them, our most efficacious intercession;
in consequence of which several merchants have already
obtained, in proportion to their demands, a considerable
indemnification. Nevertheless, although we doubt not,
that all the others will be equally indemnified by the belligerent
powers, yet we cannot regard the particular compensation
of individuals, as a sufficient pledge of the safety
upon which neutral nations may hereafter depend. From
this motive, we have resolved not only to take measures
the most effectual for the maintenance of the maritime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
commerce of our subjects, but to put them in execution, in
case of need. They have already been announced to all
Europe, by a declaration delivered in the same terms to
the three belligerent powers, by which we fix expressly
and with precision, the rights and prerogatives of a commercial
neutral flag. The one and the other are founded
either upon the proper terms of our Treaty of Commerce
with the Crown of Great Britain, or upon the evident and
immutable principles of the law of nature and nations. But
while we require of other nations, for our proper utility the
entire and unlimited accomplishment of their duties, we
are not less fixed in the intention on our part to observe
inviolably, in regard to them, the obligations of the strictest
neutrality. Thus it is necessary, that all our subjects
should conform themselves vigorously in their maritime
commerce, and in the enterprises relative to it, to this our
will. In default of which, they will render themselves unworthy
of our protection and of our succor. But to the
end, that no man may fall into error by ignorance, we
order our College of Commerce to notify the Russian merchants
trading in our ports, that while they enjoy an entire
liberty of trading and sending their vessels to all parts of
Europe, they are bound to observe, conformably to our
treaties with different powers, and to the ordinances of
each place, that which follows."</p>

<p>This is the preamble; the purview shall be sent to Congress
as soon as it appears.</p>

<p>It seems that the Empress, as well as the Ottoman
Porte, has not a little resented the indecent and groundless
assertions, with which England has filled Europe and America,
that the Empress would take part with them, and
that there were misunderstandings subsisting between Petersburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and Constantinople. I think it can be no longer
doubted, that Russia will never take part with England,
and that while she is determined upon a neutrality, every
other maritime power of Europe must do the same, or
join against England. It is equally plain, that England
must come into the system of rights preparing for neutrals,
or go to war with all the maritime powers of the world.
This is too decisively and obviously advantageous to North
America, to need any comments.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 15th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The news from Constantinople is, "that upon the advice,
that a fleet of French merchant-men from Marseilles, was
blocked up by the English cruisers in the port of Milo, the
Count de St Priest, Ambassador of France, presented a
Memoir to the Porte, complaining of this last violation of
the last agreement made between the Ottoman government
and the Ambassadors of the belligerent powers, for the
maintenance of the neutrality. In consequence, the Reis
Effendi requested Mr Ainslie, the British Ambassador, to
give orders conformably to the said agreement, to the cruisers
of his nation, to respect the coasts, forts, and havens
of the Ottoman Empire, and not to commit hostilities but
in open sea. The Ambassador answered, "that he approved
the requisitions of the Porte too much, not to contribute
all that lay in his power, to make the English cruisers
observe the orders which had been before given them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Nevertheless, the Count de St Priest judged proper, by
way of further precaution, to send the consul of his nation,
who resides at the Dardanelles, to the Capitan Pacha,
who is now in the Archipelago with his fleet, to desire him
to have a care that the French fleet should suffer no insult.
The Ottoman Admiral immediately complied with
this requisition; and we learn by the French consul, who
is returned here, that having found this commandant at
Metelin, he had no sooner learned the object of his commission,
than he detached some to go to the succor of the
fleet blocked at Milo. But his assistance will not have
been necessary, because, according to letters from Smyrna,
the six English cruisers, which held the French fleet
shut up, having had the audacity to attack this convoy
even in the port, the Chevalier d'Entrecasteux, who commanded
it, had shattered them, after an engagement of
several hours, in such a manner, that he had put them out
of a condition to keep the sea, and that they must have
retired to Paros."</p>

<p><em>Stockholm, 27th of June.</em> "The King having judged
proper to name an Admiral General of his fleet, has
chosen for this eminent post, the Major-General and Commander
of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sword,
Henry de Trolle. M. de Moussin Puschkin, Envoy from
Russia, is arrived here from Petersburg."</p>

<p><em>Hague, 10th of July.</em> "The Admiralty of Amsterdam
has put in commission, with the advice of the Prince
Stadtholder, the vessels, the Admiral de Reister, of sixtyeight
guns, and the Hereditary Prince, of fiftysix."</p>

<p><em>Hamburg, 23d of June.</em> The Mars, a Danish man-of-war
of fifty guns, commanded by Captain Luken, and
three frigates, with seventyeight merchant ships of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
nations, under convoy, sailed from the Sound the 18th
of this month."</p>

<p>It thus appears, that Russia, Holland, Sweden, and Denmark,
are proceeding in earnest to convoy their trade,
and increase their naval force, to protect the confederacy
in favor of the rights of neutrality.</p>

body whatever, and to take every necessary precaution,
that the British Ministry may not have a premature knowledge
of them. You will no doubt readily feel the motives,
which induce me to advise you to take this precaution, and
it would be needless to explain them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>1. I should have been very happy if your Excellency
had hinted at the reasons, which were then in your mind,
because after reflecting upon this subject, as maturely as I
can, I am not able to collect any reasons, which appear to
me sufficient for concealing the nature of my powers in
their full extent, from the Court of London. On the contrary,
many arguments have occurred to me, which seem
to show it to be both the policy of the United States, and
my particular duty, to communicate them.</p>

<p>2. Your Excellency will recollect that my commissions
empower me to join with the Ministers of the belligerent
powers in making peace; to make a treaty of commerce
with the Ministers of his Britannic Majesty, and to represent
the Congress as their Minister Plenipotentiary, at the
Court of London. It seems to me then, inconsistent with
the design and nature of my appointments, to conceal them
from the Court of London.</p>

<p>3. I think also, that announcing my powers to the Court
of London, would have a tendency to draw out from them
some proofs of their present designs, and it is always important
to discover early the intentions of the enemy, that
the people may be prepared, both with councils and forces,
to resist them if hostile.</p>

<p>4. The English nation would expect of the Ministers,
that some answer should be given to me. If it should be
an insolent one, as there is too much cause to expect, it
will prepare the minds of the Americans, and of the other
belligerent powers, for what they are to expect, and it will
alarm and arouse, if anything can, the people of England.</p>

<p>5. At this particular time, when an election approaches,
it would throw the Ministry into some embarrassment, for
the people of England sigh for peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>6. Another consideration has weight with me; a great
part of Europe, as well as the people of England, are
amused by the English Ministers and their emissaries, with
reports that there is some secret treaty between France
and the United States, by which the former has secured to
themselves exclusive privileges in some branches of the
American commerce, which misrepresentations, as they
are at present an obstruction to peace, would be cleared
up by the communication of my powers.</p>

<p>7. There are at present many persons of consideration
in England, who have long followed the Ministry in the war
against America, who begin to see the impracticability of
succeeding, and now vote for peace, and will lay hold of
every occurrence that favors its accomplishment.</p>

<p>8. At this moment, under the wild impression, that the
surrender of Charleston has made, it might be improper
to make the communication, but upon the news coming of
M. de Ternay's arrival, of Don Solano's, or both, or upon
the receipt of some intelligence, which may take off a part
of this impression, I submit it to your Excellency's consideration,
whether it would not be proper to communicate
my appointments to Lord George Germain. It seems to
be most proper that it should be done, so that the nation
may consider them before the meeting of Parliament, and
that those who are for peace may digest their plans accordingly.</p>

<p>9. Notwithstanding the suppression of the late riots, and
the consequent temporary relaxation of the committees and
associations, the nation is in a most critical situation.
Those disturbances were not simply the effect of fanaticism
and bigotry, but of deep and general discontent and
distress among the people; and although the Ministry may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
at present be confident they have suppressed them forever,
they will surely find themselves mistaken if they pursue
this war. I know of no measure, that will be more likely
to increase the opposition against Administration than communicating
my powers. It will at least show all the world,
that the continuance of the war and the consequent ruin
of England is their own fault, not that of the Americans,
who are ready to make peace upon terms honorable and
advantageous to Great Britain.</p>

<p>10. I am the more confirmed in those opinions, by the
communication your Excellency made to me yesterday of
the message sent by the Court of London to the Court of
Madrid. I am convinced in my own mind, that that message
is insidious in the last degree, and that it is intended
to answer two ends only; first, to spy out what they can
of the political and military plans of Spain; secondly, and
principally, to amuse France, Spain, and America too, with
false ideas of pacific inclinations, simply in order to slacken
and enervate their preparations for the next campaign.</p>

<p>11. Sincere intentions of making peace upon any terms,
which France or America can agree to, consistent with
subsisting treaties, I am as sure they have not, as I am
of their existence. Now I think there is no way of counteracting
this insidious policy so honorably and so effectually,
as by a frank and decent communication of my full
powers. This will necessitate them to come to an explanation
of their real intentions concerning America; for
there, Sir, lies the obstacle to peace; all other questions
would be soon arranged if that was settled.</p>

<p>I hope your Excellency will pardon the long letters I
write you, because it is really a voluminous subject we
have in contemplation, and mankind in general are little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
less interested in it, than our particular countries. I shall
hope for the honor of your Excellency's answer upon
these subjects.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 19th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The news from Petersburg of the 16th of June, is, that
the fleet destined for the protection of the commerce of
that empire was ready to sail. Of the three squadrons
of which it is composed, one is to cruise, as they learn, in
the North Sea, the other upon the coast of Portugal, and
the third in the Mediterranean. This last will winter at
Leghorn, and the two first in some port of a friendly
power, upon the North Sea, or in the Baltic.</p>

<p>The news from Copenhagen of the 4th of July, is, that
"the maritime forces of the northern powers begin to put
themselves in motion for the protection of their commerce,
in regard to the belligerent powers. The vessels, the
King of Jutland, and the Prince Frederick, of seventy
guns, commanded by the Captains de Kaas, and Lous,
have put into the Road, the 30th of June. The better to
man them, as well as the other vessels of our squadron, we
have embarked several detachments of the regiments of
infantry of Holstein, Falster, and Jutland. The first of
July we saw pass by here, towards the Sound, three Swedish
ships of the line, coming from the Baltic; and the
next day the Russian fleet, composed of fifteen ships of the
line, and of several frigates, came to anchor in our Road,
separated into three divisions under the command of Vice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Admirals de Borislow, de Kruse, and de Polibin. They
say, that is to be followed by the Admiral's vessel, commanded
by Vice Admiral Greigh, in quality of Commander-in-Chief
of all the fleet."</p>

<p>The following are the articles of the Ordinance of the
Empress of Russia, concerning the navigation of the merchant
flag of Russia.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article I</span>. They may not take any part in the war,
directly nor indirectly, or under any pretext whatsoever;
and they may not even give succor to any of the powers
at war by carrying them merchandises of contraband under
the Russian flag. These consist namely, in cannon, mortars,
muskets, pistols, bombs, grenades, bullets, or balls,
proper to fire, fusils, flints, matches, powder, saltpetre, sulphur,
cutlasses, pikes, swords, scabbards, gibernes, saddles,
and bridles. They ought also to take special care, that
there be not found on board of any vessel more of these
warlike stores, than they have occasion for, for their own
use, and so much that each sailor or passenger may be
sufficiently provided.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article II</span>. All other merchandises, whoever may
be the owners, and even although they belong to the subjects
of one or another of the belligerent powers, may be
freely embarked upon Russian vessels, and shall enjoy on
board of them equally with the merchandises of our subjects,
the protection of the Russian flag, excepting those,
which are contained in the first article, under the name of
contraband, as in fact they are declared such in the
eleventh article of our Treaty of Commerce with England.
By means of this safety of merchandises permitted in neutral
vessels, our subjects ought also to have a care not to
embark effects which belong to them, upon vessels of nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
engaged in the war, to the end to avoid thus all disagreements
and disagreeable rencontres.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article iii.</span> Every vessel going out of the port of
this city, or of any other of our empire, ought to be furnished
with sufficient proofs, that she belongs to Russian subjects;
to wit, with sea-letters, as is the usage, and with a
certificate of the custom-house, in which it may be declared
first, with what merchandises she is loaded, and
how much; secondly, on the account of whom they have
been purchased, and to whom the vessel and the cargo are
addressed. For the greater safety, the certificates sent by
the custom-house shall be inspected by the Admiralty, or
in his default by the magistrate of the place.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article iv.</span> Not only our native subjects shall enjoy
these prerogatives, but also strangers who are settled in
our dominions, and who bear like them the public burdens;
that is to say, during the time that they shall sojourn in our
country, since, in no other case can it be permitted them
to employ the merchant flag of Russia.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article v.</span> Each Russian vessel, even in case one
single owner expedites two or three vessels at a time for
the same place, ought to be provided in particular with the
documents mentioned in the third article, which may serve
to justify their property in case that these ships should separate
during the voyage, or be obliged to pursue different
routes.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article vi.</span> It is forbidden to every Russian vessel
to have connoissements, charter parties, or other sea papers
double, or doubtful, much less false declarations, inasmuch
as these always expose to an inevitable danger. Thus
they should give their principal attention, that their documents
be in good order and prove clearly, as it is said before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the true destination of the vessel, and the nature of
her cargo. It is also necessary, that the contract between
the owner of the merchandises and the master of the vessel,
or the agreement known under the name of charter
party, be always on board. But as it happens very often,
that the owner of merchandises, in making his adventure,
whether in his own vessel, or whether in a neutral vessel
freighted by him, fixes the sale of them solely by speculation,
by preference in some port, and in case the price in
this port is too low, in some port more distant; in this case
they ought not to fail to name and settle the two ports,
according to the order of the route and their situation in
one single connoissement, and not in two. They ought
also to observe the same precautions in regard to the charter
parties, to the end, that there may be no difference
between them and the connoissements; and in case that
any one of our subjects, in contempt of these dispositions,
shall allow himself in artifice and duplicity, he may assure
himself, that he shall never enjoy our protection, which is
granted only to lawful and innocent commerce, and by no
means to illicit and fraudulent traffic.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article vii.</span> Every Russian vessel, which, after
having unloaded her cargo in any foreign port, has a design
to return into her country, or to proceed further in
another foreign place, ought to provide herself in this port
and in every other, at which she may stop to trade, with
the documents required by the usages of the country, to
the end, that they may prove at all times the nation to
which the ship belongs, the port from which she comes,
that to which she is bound, and the merchandises with
which she has been loaded anew.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article viii.</span> Forasmuch as the aforesaid documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
are indispensably necessary to prove the neutral
property of effects, which are found on board the ship, they
ought particularly to take care not to throw them into the
sea, no more than any other writings or papers, without
any exception upon any occasion whatever, especially on
the rencontre of any other vessel, inasmuch as by such a
step one might expose himself to well founded suspicions,
and to disagreeable consequences.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article ix.</span> It is necessary to have a scrupulous
attention, that there be not on board of any Russian vessel
any merchant, clerk, and never more than one third of the
seamen, subjects of the belligerent powers, because by
conducting differently such vessel might expose herself to
sustain disagreeable disappointments. But as a similar inconvenience
may easily happen to those sorts of ships,
which in time of war are purchased of the subjects of the
belligerent powers, for this reason, from this time, and as
long as the present maritime war shall last, the said vessels
may not be purchased, unless under condition, that they
shall be solely employed in the Baltic, or the Black Sea.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article x.</span> The carriage of all merchandise whatsoever,
into places blocked or besieged by sea and by land,
is entirely prohibited, in consequence of which, if any of
the merchants of this empire, engaged by the hope of gain,
shall intermeddle in any such traffic, whatever loss he may
sustain, he cannot ever have the right of demanding our
protection.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article xi.</span> All our subjects who, by reason of their
commerce, find themselves in foreign countries, ought to
conform themselves exactly to the civil and mercantile
laws, which shall there subsist, as well as to the ordinances
of every place where they live, or to which they may send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
their vessels. Nevertheless, to the end that they may, as
much as possible, be instructed in those laws and ordinances,
the College of Foreign Affairs will communicate to
that of Commerce, all the writings that have relation thereto,
that they may be able to give notice of them to the merchants
by the means of the public papers.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article xii.</span> Although our intention is, to protect
efficaciously and vigorously the navigation and the commerce
of our faithful subjects, nevertheless, we intend not
by any means to permit that there result from it the least
prejudice to one or the other of the belligerent powers, or
that individual merchants should profit of it to make unlawful
gain. To this effect, we forbid expressly any of our
merchants and trading subjects to permit strangers to negotiate,
or send ships to sea, under his name. Every person
who shall in this respect transgress our will, shall be
deprived forever of our imperial protection for his vessels,
as well as of the right of fitting them out in future. If our
subjects, interested in maritime commerce, follow exactly
this ordinance in all its points, they may be assured of our
entire and unlimited protection concerning their affairs in
foreign countries, as well as of a zealous and affectionate
intervention on the part of the Ministers, Agents, and Consuls,
who reside there on our part. To this end, our College
of Foreign Affairs will communicate to them in sufficient
season the most precise instructions. But those
among our subjects who shall depart from these regulations,
ought not to expect the least protection on our part,
whatever unfortunate accidents and other damages they
may sustain, by their voluntary transgression of the orders
which they shall have received, and not to depart from the
requisite circumspection recommended to them. The College<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of Commerce, in notifying this ordinance to the body
of Russian merchants trading in our ports, shall at the
same time be held to furnish the custom-houses with the
necessary instructions relative to this order, as well as to
communicate our will to the Governors of Provinces where
there are ports, that at the same time they may be observed
in all the tribunals which may concern them."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 19th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There is an article of news from Copenhagen of the 4th
of July. "The vessels of war, the Prince Frederick and
the Jutland, each of seventy guns, and the frigates, the
Pearl and the Alsen, are in the Road. The Admiral's flag
will be hoisted on the 6th on board the Justitia, of seventyfour
guns, and all the Dutch fleet will consist, this year, of
ten ships of the line, from seventyfour to fifty guns, and
six frigates, thirtysix to thirty. There has already sailed
of this fleet, one ship of sixty guns, for the coast of Guinea;
one of fifty is in the north sea; another is in the Road
of Elsinore, for a guard ship, and three frigates have sailed
for America. Thus the squadron will remain composed
of seven ships of the line and three frigates, which are to
join the Russian fleet. Yesterday and the day before,
arrived in the Road of this city a Russian fleet, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of fifteen ships of the line and four frigates, under the command
of Admiral Borislow, of Vice Admiral Kruse, and of
the commandant, Polibin; and on the 1st of this month,
there passed before the port of this city, the Swedish ships
of war, coming from the Baltic Sea, and making sail toward
the Sound."</p>

<p><em>Elsinore, 27th of June.</em> "There has sailed from this
port a convoy of eighteen merchant ships, destined for the
North Sea, under the convoy of a Swedish ship of the line
and a frigate."</p>

<p>There is a paragraph in the Amsterdam Gazette of the
14th, which is worth translating, because these paragraphs
oftentimes betray a great deal of politics. It is this; "the
conquest of Mobile, made by the Spaniards, the news of
which has lately arrived here, appears so much the more
important, as it leads infallibly to that of Pensacola, by
which the Spaniards may cut off one of the principal avenues
of Jamaica, and may, in time, intercept the commerce
and the provisions of this Island, from whence they
are much annoyed at Mexico by the English, who sufficiently
incline to extend themselves when they can, and had
made since the peace so great progress in this part of the
world, that to stop them, the war was become almost indispensable
to Spain." It might have been added, that it was
become indispensable to France too; for the English have
ever made it a maxim to go to war with France, as she
had a fine fleet and a flourishing commerce. Burn, sink,
and destroy, were the words with England whenever a formidable
navy appeared upon the ocean, belonging to any
other nation.</p>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p class="head">
Versailles, July 20th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you did me the honor
to write me on the 13th of this month. I am very sensible
of the confidence with which you have communicated
your ideas on the present situation of the United States,
and the need they have of the immediate assistance of
some ships of the line and some frigates. The Chevalier
de Ternay and the Count de Rochambeau, are sent with
the express design, which is the subject of your letter.
They will concert their operations with Congress and with
General Washington. And as the King has given them no
precise orders with regard to their return to Europe, but
has left them at liberty to act as they shall judge proper
for the relief of America, there is every reason to believe,
that they will take their station during next winter in
North America, if that shall be agreeable to Congress,
and that they will employ the ships and troops under their
command, according to the plan that shall be settled between
them and the American Generals.</p>

<p>You will perceive, Sir, by this detail, that the King is
far from abandoning the cause of America, and that his
Majesty, without having been solicited by Congress, has
taken effectual measures to support the cause of America.
I flatter myself, Sir, that these generous proceedings will
excite suitable sensations in America, and that they will
prevail over the falsehoods, which the common enemy and
their wicked adherents propagate there, in order to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
suspicions of France, and to induce the Americans to take
resolutions, which will terminate in their slavery and dishonor.</p>

<p>I have received the letter you did me the honor to

will winter in North America.</p>

<p>I assure your Excellency, that scarcely any news I ever
heard, gave me more satisfaction; and nothing, in my
opinion, can afford a more effectual assistance to America,
or make deeper or more grateful impression on the minds
of her inhabitants.</p>

<p>I am infinitely mistaken, if the service of the King in
the conduct of the war, both in the West Indies and North
America, does not derive such essential advantages from
this measure, as will demonstrate its wisdom to all the
world, as well as to the English and Americans the King's

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 22d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>The King of England's speech at the prorogation of
Parliament, contains nothing remarkable, worth the attention
of America, except compliments to the two Houses
upon their magnanimity and perseverance in the pursuits
of this just and necessary war, which he says, has put it in
his power to make such efforts, that he dares hope, with
the aid of Divine Providence, to disconcert the violent and
unjust designs of his enemies, and induce them to listen to
equitable and honorable terms of peace. These efforts
have already been followed by success both by sea and
land, and the happy and important turn, which affairs have
lately taken in North America, makes me conceive the
best founded hopes of the return of the affection and loyalty
of my subjects of the Colonies, and of their happy reunion
with their mother country.</p>

<p>There is one more sentence, which deserves attention.
"Exert yourselves to inculcate this important truth, that
rebellious insurrections to resist or reform the laws, cannot
fail to terminate in the destruction of those who have
made the attempt, or by the subversion of our happy and
free constitution." Americans will make their own reflections
on this speech. It is very certain, that it has not the
air nor the spirit of peace.</p>

<p><em>Madrid, the 27th of June.</em> "We expect to learn in a few
days, the formation of the combined fleet in the Bay of Cadiz.
The following is the state of the Spanish vessels which are
now there, ready to go out under the command of Lieutenant
General Don Louis de Cordova; La Tres Sainte
Trinite, of one hundred and twenty guns; the Foudre and S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Ferdinand of eighty; the Sainte Isabelle, the Ange Gardien,
the Serieux, the Atlas, the St Pierre Apotre, the Orient,
the St Raphael, the St Joachim, the St Damase, the St
Isidore, the St Eugene, and the St Laurent of seventy;
the Mino of fiftysix; the frigates, the Ste Lucie of thirtysix,
the Ste Rufine of twentyeight, the Ste Barbe, and the Assomption
of twentysix; the chebecs, the Majorquais, and
the Murcien of thirtysix; the St Sebastian of twentyfour,
and the corvette, the Ste Catharine of eighteen. To these
vessels must be added the squadron of Ferrol, which
entered on the 23d of May in the Bay of Cadiz, under the
command of Don Athanasio Baranda, and composed of the
vessels, the Conception of ninety; the St Charles and the
St Vincent of eighty; the Ferme, the Galice, the St Paschal,
and the Brilliant of seventy; the Septentrion of sixtyfour;
the frigates, El Carmen and the Perpetua of thirtysix;
as well as the corvette, the Ste Helene of twentytwo guns;
making thus a total of twentyfour ships of the line, six
frigates, four chebecs, and two cutters."</p>

<p><em>Cadiz, the 24th of June.</em> "The squadron of M. de
Beausset, composed of seven ships of the line, anchored
on the 18th in this Bay. His frigates brought in two small
ships loaded with corn and flour, and a cutter of twelve
guns. The cruise of this squadron has served very much
to keep the enemy's cruisers at a distance; and the neutrals
not fearing to be disturbed, have come here in great
numbers. The 19th, the Protector, commanded by M.
D. Achen, arrived here; she fell into the midst of the
Quebec fleet; but as she sailed ill and had no frigate,
(the Galatea having been separated from her) she was not
able to take more than two vessels, the cargoes of which
were rich enough, and which she sent into Lisbon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>Thus the French and Spanish ships at Cadiz amount
to thirty of the line. This fleet, combined with that of
Brest, and with the Active, the Guerrier and the Cæsar,
gone to convoy merchantmen to a certain latitude, and to
a ship of one hundred and ten guns, from Rochfort, and all
commanded by the Count d'Estaing, would give a good
account of the English.</p>

<p><em>Petersburg, 23d of June.</em> "The squadron equipped at
Cronstadt, having received its last orders, sailed from thence
the 19th of this month. As the service to which it is destined
will not permit it to return before winter in the ports
of this empire, the Court has sent to its Ministers in Holland,
England, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Denmark,
orders to request of those respective powers, that there
may be granted to this squadron a free entry into their ports,
and all the succor of which they may have occasion, in case
they should be obliged to put in there by any accident," &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Copenhagen, 4th of July.</em> "The arrival of the fleet
of fifteen Russian ships of the line in our port, is soon to
be followed by the departure of the Danish fleet. The
Justice, of seventyfour guns, the last of the vessels that we
have armed to form it, will go tomorrow into the Road;
and the day after, the Vice Admiral de Schindel will hoist
his flag on board of her. We shall then have in service
eight ships of the line, two of fifty guns, and six frigates,
to wit, the Justice, and the Princess Sophia Frederick,
commandant Krieger, of seventyfour; the Jutland, and the
Prince Frederick, Commandants de Kaas and Lous, of
seventy; the Droit d'Indigénat and the Wagrie, Captains
Gormar and Bille, of sixtyfour; the Dannebrog and the
Holstein, Captains Ellebracht and U. C. Kaas, of sixty; the
Mars and the Greenland, Captains Lutken and Knudsen, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
fifty; the Bornholm and the Riel, Captains Schaning and
Tender, of thirtysix; the Moen, Captain Budde, of thirtyfour;
the Cronberg, Captain Ziervogel, of thirtytwo; the
Alsen, Captain Count de Reventlau, of twentyfour, and
the Christian, Captain Stockflelk, of twenty guns. Of
these, nevertheless, the Holstein sailed the 30th for Guinea;
the Bornholm, the Moen, and the Christian, are in the
islands of America, and the Greenland serves as a guard
ship in the Road of Helsingore."</p>

<p>Whatever may be the part that either powers will take
in regard to the project of an armed neutrality, the three
Crowns of the North appear uniform in their measures for
the protection of the commerce of their subjects, and these
measures have already the effect, that their ships, particularly
the Swedish and Danish, are already sought for
freight in the Baltic, in preference to all others, while on
the other side there arrives no neutral vessels from the
North Sea, in the Sound, which does not make the most
bitter complaints concerning the ill treatment received from
English privateers. A Dutch ship has had nineteen of
them on board of him since his departure from the coast of
France, and a Russian ship has been robbed of all his
victuals by these pirates, who had left him nothing but
Gruau-Water, and eighteen pounds of bread, upon which
eight men were to subsist during three weeks.</p>

<p><em>Hague, 17th of July.</em> "Affairs between our Republic
and the Court of London are still in the same state of
indecision. We learn, that the latter has answered, by the
Viscount Stormont to the different Memoirs presented
during some weeks, by the Envoy, the Count de Welderen,
in which, he insisted upon the stipulations of the treaty of
1674. 'That in answer to these Memorials, and to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
those, which could be presented of the same nature, he,
Lord Stormont, observed that the Count de Welderen insisted
upon that, which at this time no longer existed; that
it would be superfluous to repeat what had passed upon
this subject, that he should confine himself, therefore, to
remind him of the order, which the King had given in
his Council, on the 17th of last April, and of which he
had had the honor to give him official information.'"</p>

<p>I am thus particular in laying before Congress a state of
the navies of Europe, because they show the unanimity
and ardor, with which all the maritime powers are intent
upon their commercial and naval interests, upon the freedom
of commerce and navigation, and upon the rights of
neutral nations, and to show, that America is universally
considered by them as such a magazine of raw materials
for manufactures, such a source of commerce, and such a
nursery of seamen, and naval power, that they are determined,
that no one power in Europe shall ever again monopolise
it. We must, however, fight our own battles, and
bear our own expenses; for the slow march of those powers,
their maxims of dignity and systems of etiquette are such,
that they must have their own way, and operate in their
own time. England has hints and warnings enough, but
she will not take them. These events, however, all show
the wisdom of Congress, in planning the first treaty, which
was first sent to the Court of Versailles, upon the principle
of perfect equality and reciprocity, granting no exclusive
privileges, and binding herself to no obligation not to admit
any other, and all other nations to the same; principles
from which it is to be presumed we shall not depart.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 23d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have been amused some time with dark and unintelligible
hints in letters from London, of some messenger sent
from Lord North to Madrid.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago I waited on the Count de Vergennes,
at Versailles, to acquaint him, that I had an intention of
making a journey to Amsterdam for a few weeks, as I flattered
myself I might form some acquaintances, or correspondences
there, and collect some intelligence, that might
be useful to the United States. His Excellency desired
me to wait some time, for that in eight or ten days he believed
he should have something to communicate to me.
I assured him, that I would not go till I saw him again, or
heard further from him. This day sevennight, his Excellency
informed me, that he was ready to let me know, that
a messenger from the Court of London had arrived at
Madrid, that the Spanish Ministry had demanded the sentiments
of the British Court concerning America. He
said he was not instructed. He was told he must previously
explain himself upon that subject. He determined
to send an express to London for instructions. This the
Count de Vergennes said would take up two months, and
consequently leave me time enough to go to Holland, but
if anything should happen in the meantime, he would give
me the earliest information of it.</p>

<p>In the Courier de l'Europe of the 14th of July, is this
paragraph.</p>

<p>"The report runs, that a person who has been Secretary
of the Marquis d'Almodavar, during his embassy from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the Court of Madrid to that of London, arrived here,
(London,) some weeks ago, on board the Milford, coming
from Oporto, that after a stay of eight days, this frigate
had orders to transport to Lisbon this person, accompanied
by Mr Cumberland, Secretary of Lord George Germain,
whose instructions imply, that if at the end of twenty days
he is not called to Madrid, he is to return here immediately.
As soon as this person arrived at Lisbon, he set out
for Madrid, where fifteen days after, Mr Cumberland was
invited to go, and where he is at present."</p>

<p>There is a body of people in England who are zealous
and clamorous for peace, and the Ministry find their account
in amusing and silencing them by equivocal appearances of
negotiations. They have ever made it a part of their political
system, to hold out to America some false hopes of reconciliation
and peace, in order to slacken our nerves and
retard our preparations. They think also, that they can
amuse the Courts of France and Spain, with a talk about
conferences and negotiations, while they are secretly concerting
measures to succor Gibraltar, and carry on their
operations the next campaign. But serious thoughts of
peace upon any terms that we can agree to, I am persuaded
they never had; but if they ever did entertain any
thoughts of negotiation, it must have been at the time of
their consternation for Sir Henry Clinton, and their despair
of his success.</p>

<p>The total and absolute suppression of the tumults in
London, and the triumphant success of Clinton, beyond
their most sanguine expectations, has now given them such
confidence and exaltation that the people of America will
dethrone Congress, and, like the Israelites of old, demand a
king, that they now think of nothing but unconditional submission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
or at least of delusive proffers of terms, which
they know the majesty of the people in America will not
agree to, in order to divide us, to make a few gentlemen
apostates, and some soldiers deserters.</p>

Versailles, July 25th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you have done me the
honor to write to me on the 17th of this month. I have
read it with the most serious attention, and in order to give
you an answer with greater exactness, I have placed in the
margin every paragraph which seemed to require observations
on my part. You will there see, Sir, that I continue
to be of opinion, that the time to communicate your
Plenipotentiary power to Lord Germain is not yet come,
and you will there find the reasons on which I ground my
opinion. I have no doubt you will feel the force of them,
and that they will determine you to think as I do. But if
that should not be the case, I pray you, and in the name of
the King request you, to communicate your letter and my
answer to the United States, and to suspend until you shall
receive orders from them, all measures with regard to the
English Ministry. I shall on my part, transmit my observations
to America, that M. de la Luzerne may communicate
them to the members of Congress, and I am persuaded
that that assembly will think the opinion of the Ministry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3><em>Observations on Mr Adams's Letter of July 17th, 1780.</em></h3>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p>I. The reasons, which determined the Count de Vergennes
to give Mr Adams that advice are so plain, that
they must appear at first view.</p>

<p>1st. To be solicitous about a Treaty of Commerce,
before peace is established, is like being busy about furnishing
a house, before the foundation is laid.</p>

<p>2d. In the situation in which America stands at present
with regard to England, to announce to that power that
they have forgotten her system of tyranny, her cruelties,
and her perfidy, is discovering too great a degree of weakness,
or at least too much good nature, and inviting her to
believe, that the Americans have an irresistible predilection
for her, and to fortify her in the opinion she entertains, that
the American patriots will submit through weariness, or the
preponderating influence of the tories.</p>

<p>3d. To propose a Treaty of Commerce, which must be
founded on confidence, and on a union equivalent to an alliance,
at a time when the war is raging in all its fury, when
the Court of London is wishing to ruin or to subjugate
America, what is it but to give credit to the opinion, which
all Europe entertains, conformable to the assertions of the
English Ministers, that the United States incline towards a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
defection, and that they will be faithful to their engagements
with France, only till such time as Great Britain shall furnish
a pretext for breaking them.</p>

<p>II. A person may be furnished eventually with plenipotentiary
powers, without being under the necessity of
publishing them, until circumstances permit him to use
them. This happens every day. Mr Adams is charged
with three distinct commissions. 1. To take a share in
the future negotiations for peace. 2. To conclude a treaty
of commerce with Great Britain. 3. To represent the
United States at the Court of London. It requires no
great effort of genius to show, that these three objects cannot
be accomplished at the same moment of time, nor that
the two last cannot serve as an introduction to the first. It
is necessary first of all to obtain from England an acknowledgment
of the Independence of America, and that acknowledgment
must serve as a foundation for a treaty of
peace. Until this is obtained, Mr Adams cannot talk of a
treaty of commerce. To propose one while the Court of
London is flattering itself with the hopes of subduing America,
and while with that view it is making the most strenuous
efforts, would in the view of that Court be to propose
what was chimerical, and would be taking a step which it
would hold in derision.</p>

<p>The case would be the same, were one at this time to
talk of a Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States
appointed to reside at the Court of his Britannic Majesty.
The only powers, therefore, which circumstances permit
Mr Adams to announce, are those which authorise him to
take a part in the negotiations for peace. The two other
powers can be of no avail until the conclusion of that peace,
so that it would be at least useless to produce them at present;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and consequently Mr Adams will not act inconsistent
with the design and nature of his appointment by concealing
them from the Court of London. Although the Count
de Vergennes is unacquainted with the instructions of Mr
Adams, yet he is persuaded that they are conformable to
the foregoing reflections, and that they do not direct him to
make an immediate communication of his powers relative
to a treaty of commerce, any more than they order him to
make a separate peace with Great Britain. This opinion
is founded on that which the King's Ministry entertain of
the wisdom, prudence and fidelity of Congress.</p>

<p>III. It is to be observed, that the English Ministry
would consider that communication as ridiculous; so that
it is deceiving one's self to suppose, that it will engage
them to enter into any conference, or so say anything more
than what is contained in the resolutions of Parliament,
namely, that they will listen to the Americans and receive
them into favor, when they return to their former allegiance.
It can answer no good purpose to draw from
them such an answer, nor can the United States want such
an answer, to inform them of the present sentiments of the
Court of London, and much less to prepare with councils
and arms to resist them. It is astonishing to talk of preparations
of councils and arms, when the war is raging in all
its fury, when it has now lasted six years, and England has
not yet made one overture to the Americans, that can authorise
them to believe that she would agree to their independence.</p>

<p>IV. The English Ministry would either return no answer,
or if they did it would be an insolent one. In case
of the latter, why should a man needlessly expose himself
to insult, and thereby make himself the laughing-stock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
all the nations who have not yet acknowledged the independence
of the United States? But there is reason to
believe that Mr Adams would receive no answer, because
the British Ministry would not think themselves bound to
return one to a man who assumes a character, which the
Court of London must consider as an insult. It should not
be forgotten, that that Court always considers the Americans
as rebellious subjects. With such an opinion, how
could Lord Germain receive a letter from Mr Adams,
taking upon himself the character of Minister Plenipotentiary
from the United States of North America? How
could that Minister bear the mention of a treaty of commerce,
which can only take place between independent
nations? These observations will convince Mr Adams,
that France has no occasion for the expedient which he
proposes, to discover the sentiments and dispositions of the
Court of London, and that we are already perfectly acquainted
with what we ought and may expect from it, in
the present situation of affairs.</p>

<p>V. The silence, or the answer of the English Ministry,
let which will happen, will neither alarm nor arouse the
people of England. That people, without doubt, desire
peace and an accommodation with America. But we find
that only some individuals talk of independence, and these,
more from a spirit of opposition than from conviction.
There never has been a single motion made in Parliament
tending to grant that independence. Yet the people have
friends and protectors in Parliament. From this, Mr
Adams may judge into what embarrassment the announcing
his powers would throw the Ministry.</p>

<p>VI. England, as well as the rest of Europe, is perfectly
acquainted with the nature of the engagements, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
subsist between France and the United States. The King
caused a declaration to be made by his Ministry on the
13th of March, 1778, that he had not secured to himself
any exclusive privilege by the treaty of commerce of the
6th of February of the same year, and his Majesty has
confirmed that declaration in a writing published by his
order. So that the plenipotentiary powers of Mr Adams
can disclose nothing new, either to England or to the other
powers of Europe, and the false opinion of the Court of
London in this matter can be no obstacle to a peace. If
any such obstacle existed, the English Ministry would
themselves find means to remove it, if they were determined
to make peace; depend upon that.</p>

<p>VII. It is certain that the whole English nation, and
even the Ministers themselves, wish for peace. But it has
been observed, that there has not been a single motion
made in favor of the independence of America. Certainly
the plenipotentiary powers of Mr Adams will not change the
present dispositions of the people in that respect, and consequently
the communication that might be made of them,
will neither facilitate nor accelerate the conclusion of peace.</p>

<p>VIII. This is a sensible reflection. It proves that Mr
Adams is himself convinced that there are circumstances,
which may induce him to conceal his powers. The King's
Ministry think that such circumstances will continue till the
English nation shall show a disposition to acknowledge the
independence of the United States. That acknowledgment
will not be facilitated by proposing a treaty of commerce.
For the English are at present well persuaded,
that they will have such a treaty with America when they
shall judge it proper. They have besides, as Mr Adams
has himself mentioned in his letter of the 19th of February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
last, a full knowledge of his commission, so that the communication
of his full powers will teach them nothing new
in this respect.</p>

<p>IX. In answer to this paragraph it may be observed,
that there is not an Englishman who is not persuaded that
the United States are disposed to grant the advantages of
commerce to their ancient metropolis; but it would be a
very difficult task to persuade an Englishman or any thinking
being, that by granting independence in exchange for
these advantages, the Court of London would make an
honorable and advantageous peace. If this was the real
sentiment of the people of England, why have they for
these six years past, without murmuring, furnished ruinous
supplies for subduing America?</p>

<p>X. The English Ministry either have sincere intentions
of making peace, or they mean to amuse and penetrate
the designs of Spain. In the first case, they will express
the conditions on which they desire to treat; they
will then be obliged to explain their views and their demands
with regard to America. They assuredly forget
nothing which they think will forward peace, and upon
agreeing to her independence, their first care will be to
demand equal privileges with France in regard to commerce.
On the contrary, if the English Ministry only
means to amuse Spain, to penetrate her designs and to
slacken her preparations for war, Mr Adams should do the
Ministry of Madrid justice to believe that they will have
sagacity enough to discover their views, and have understanding
and prudence sufficient to determine on the conduct
they ought to pursue.</p>

<p>XI. If Mr Adams is as sure as he is of his existence,
that the English Ministry have no intention of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
peace on terms which France and America can agree to,
to what purpose communicate to them at present powers,
which cannot be made use of until after the peace. How
can Mr Adams persuade himself, that the Court of London
will be seduced by the bait of a treaty of commerce, while
it still manifests an invincible repugnance to acknowledge
the independence of America. Whenever it shall be disposed
to acknowledge that independence, it will of itself
propose the conditions on which it will be then proper to
grant it, and Mr Adams may rest assured, that it will not
forget the article of commerce. Then will be the proper
time for him to produce his plenipotentiary powers. In
the meantime, it is necessary to pursue measures for the
establishing the foundation of that negotiation, namely, the
independence of America, and that can only be effected by
carrying on the war with vigor and success.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 26th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which your Excellency did
me the honor to write me on the 25th of this month.</p>

<p>The sincere respect I entertain for your Excellency's
sentiments would have determined me, upon the least intimation,
to have communicated my letter and your answer
to Congress, and to suspend, until I should receive orders
on their part, all measures towards the British Ministry,
without your Excellency's requisition in the name of the
King.</p>

<p>I shall transmit these papers to Congress, and I doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
not the reasons your Excellency has adduced will be sufficient
to induce them to suspend any communication to
the British Ministry, as it is undoubtedly their wisdom to
conduct all such measures in concert with their allies.</p>

<p>There is a great body of people in America, as determined
as any to support their independence, and their alliances,
who notwithstanding wish that no measure may be
left unattempted by Congress, or their servants, to manifest
their readiness for peace, upon such terms as they think
honorable and advantageous to all parties. Your Excellency's
arguments, or indeed your authority, will probably
be sufficient to satisfy these people, and to justify me,
whereas without them I might have been liable to the censure
of numbers. For it is most certain, that all due deference
will be shown by the people of the United States
and their servants, both in and out of Congress, to the sentiments
of the Ministry of France.</p>

<p>This deference, however, by no means extends so far as to
agree in all cases to those sentiments without examination.
I cannot, therefore, agree in the sentiment, that proposing
a treaty of peace and commerce, is discovering a great
deal of weakness, or that the Americans have forgotten the
British system of tyranny, cruelty, or perfidy, or to invite
her to believe the Americans have an irresistible predilection
for England, or to fortify her in the opinion that the
American patriots will submit through weariness, or through
fear of the preponderant influence of the tories.</p>

<p>And so far from thinking it would give credit to the opinion,
if there be such a one in all Europe, that the United
States incline towards a defection, and that they will not
be faithful to their engagements, it seems to me on the
contrary, it would discredit the opinion which prevails too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
much in Europe, that there is some secret treaty between
France and the United States, by which the former
is entitled to exclusive privileges in the American
trade.</p>

<p>It is very true, that the independence of America must
be acknowledged before a treaty of peace can be made.
But a prospect of a free trade with America, upon principles
of perfect equality and reciprocity, like that between
France and the United States, might be a powerful inducement
with the people of England, to acknowledge
American independence. Indeed I do not see any other
considerable motive, that England can ever have to make
that acknowledgment. The Congress have given no positive
instructions respecting the time or manner of making
these powers known to one Court or another. All this is
left at discretion, and to a construction of the Commissioners
themselves. It is very certain, that all the belligerent
powers are busily occupied every winter in their councils,
and preparations for the ensuing campaign. And it is also
certain, that the artifice of the British Ministry, in holding
up to view every winter some semblance of a design of
reconciliation formerly, and of peace latterly, has been a
real engine of hostility against America, equal to a considerable
part of the British army. Neither the people
of America, nor Mr Adams, have the least dread upon
their minds, of an insolent answer from one of the British
Ministers, nor of the ridicule of those nations who have
not yet acknowledged the independence of America. No
man of any knowledge, justice, or humanity, in any of
those nations, would laugh upon such an occasion, on the
contrary, he would feel a just indignation against a Minister
who should insult a message so obviously calculated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the good of England, and of all Europe, in the present
circumstances of affairs.</p>

<p>I am very much mistaken, for I speak upon memory, if
the Duke of Richmond did not make a motion two years
ago in the House of Lords, and if Mr Hartley did not
make another about a year ago, which was seconded by
Lord North himself, in the House of Commons, tending
to grant independence to America. And it is very certain,
that a great part of the people of England think that
peace can be had upon no other terms. It is most clear,
that the present Ministry will not grant independence; the
only chance of obtaining it is by change of that Ministry,
The King is so attached to that Ministry, that he will not
change them, until it appears that they have so far lost the
confidence of the people, that their representatives in Parliament
dare no longer to support them, and in the course of
the last winter the weight and sentiment of the people were
so considerable, as to bring many great questions nearly to
a balance, and particularly to carry two votes, one against
the increase of the influence of the Crown, and another
against the Board of Trade and Plantations, a vote that
seemed almost to decide the American question, and they
came within a very few votes of deciding against the
American Secretary. Now where parties are approaching
so near to a balance, even a small weight thrown into either
scale may turn it.</p>

<p>In my letter of the 19th of February, I said, that my
appointment was notorious in America, and that therefore
it was probably known to the Court of London, although
they had not regular evidence of it. The question then, was
more particularly concerning a commission to assist in the
pacification. This was published in the American newspapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
in a general way, but I have no reason to think
they are particularly informed of these matters; if they
were, no evil that I am aware of could result from giving
them the information officially. Certainly they have no
official information, and it is denied, that they know the
nature of Mr Adams' commission.</p>

<p>Without any great effort of genius, I think it is easy to
demonstrate to any thinking being, that by granting American
independence, and making a treaty of commerce upon
principles of perfect reciprocity, England would in the
present circumstances of affairs make an honorable and an
advantageous peace. It would have been more for their
honor and advantage never to have made this war against
America, it is true, but having made it, all the dishonor
and disadvantage there is in it are indelible, and after thirteen
colonies have been driven to throw off their government
and annihilate it in every root and branch, becoming
independent in fact, maintaining this independence against
a force of forty thousand men and fifty ships of war, that
would have shaken most of the States of Europe to the
foundation, after maintaining this independence four years,
and having made an honorable treaty with the first power
in Europe, after another power had fallen into the war in
consequence of the same system, after the voice of mankind
had so far declared against the justice of their cause,
that they could get no ally, but on the contrary all the
maritime powers are entering into a confederacy against
them, upon a point which has been a principal source of
their naval superiority in Europe; in these circumstances,
the only honorable part they can act, is to conform to the
opinion of mankind, and the dishonorable and ruinous part
for them to act is to continue the war. For the principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
that the people have a right to a form of government according
to their own judgments and inclinations, is, in this
intelligent age so well agreed on in the world, that it would
be thought dishonorable by mankind in general, for the
English to govern three millions of people against their
wills by military force, and this is all they can ever hope
for, even supposing they could bribe and tempt deserters
enough from our army and apostates from our cause to
make it impossible for us to carry on the war. This, however,
I know to be impossible, and that they never will get
quiet possession again of the government of any one whole
State in the thirteen; no, not for an hour. If England
considers further, that America is now known all over Europe
to be such a magazine of raw materials for manufactures,
such a nursery of seamen, and such a source of
commerce and naval power, that it would be dangerous to
all the maritime powers to suffer any one of them to establish
a domination and a monopoly again in America.</p>

<p>I know there exists in some European minds, a prejudice
against America, and a jealousy that she will be hurtful
to Europe, and England may place some dependence
upon this prejudice and jealousy, but the motions of the
maritime powers begin to convince her, that this jealousy
and prejudice do not run so deep as they thought, and
surely there never was a more groundless prejudice entertained
among men, and it must be dissipated as soon as the
subject is considered. America is a nation of husbandmen,
planted on a vast continent of wild uncultivated land, and
there is, and will be for centuries, no way in which these
people can get a living, and advance their interest so
much as by agriculture. They can apply themselves to
manufactures, only to fill up interstices of time, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
they cannot labor on their lands, and to commerce, only to
carry the produce of their lands, the raw materials of manufactures,
to the European market.</p>

<p>Europe is a country whose land is all cultivated nearly
to perfection, where the people have no way to advance
themselves but by manufactures and commerce; here are
two worlds then, fitted by God and nature, to benefit each
other, one by furnishing raw materials, the other manufactures,
and they can never interfere. The number of
States in America, their position and extension over such a
great continent, and their fundamental constitution that
nine States must concur to war, show that nine of these
States never can agree in any foreign war, or any other,
but for self defence, if they should ever become powerful.
But in this case, however disagreeable a prospect
it may open to Americans, Europe has an everlasting warranty
against their becoming dangerous to her in the nature
of men, the nature of her governments, and their position
towards one another.</p>

<p>All these circumstances serve to show, and the people of
England begin to be sensible of it, that Europe will never
suffer them to regain their domination and monopoly, even
if the English were able to extort a forced submission. In
this situation then, the only honorable and advantageous
course for England is to make peace, and open commerce
with America, in perfect consistency with her independence
and her alliances. The people of England cannot
be said to furnish subsidies without murmuring, for it is
certain there never was so much murmuring and such radical
discontent in that nation nor any other, but at the eve
of a revolution.</p>

<p>I very cheerfully agree with your Excellency in opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
that the Court of Spain has sagacity enough to penetrate
and to defeat the deceitful designs of the English, and am
not under other apprehensions from thence, than that the
report of a negotiation with Spain will leave some impressions
in America, where I believe the English Ministry
chiefly intend it. I have already said, that from the present
British Ministry I expect no peace. It is for the nation
and for the change of Ministry, as a step towards
peace, that I thought it might have some effect to make
the communication, and to satisfy those people in America,
who without the most distant thought of departing from
their independence or their alliances, wish still to take
every reasonable measure towards peace. Your Excellency's
letter will convince them, that my apprehensions
were wrong, and your advice will undoubtedly be followed,
as it ought to be; for they cannot promise themselves any
advantages from the communication equivalent to the inconveniency
of taking a measure of this kind, which ought
not to be done but in concert, against the opinion of the
Ministry of France.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, July 27th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>Since my letter of the 21st, and upon reading over
again your Excellency's letter to me of the 20th, I observed
one expression, which I think it my duty to consider
more particularly. The expression I have in view,
is this, "that the King without having been solicited by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Congress, had taken measures the most efficacious to sustain
the American cause."</p>

<p>Upon this part of your letter, I must entreat your Excellency
to recollect, that the Congress did as long, ago as
the year 1776, before Dr Franklin was sent off for France,
instruct him, Mr Deane, and Mr Lee, to solicit the King
for six ships of the line, and I have reason to believe, that
the Congress have been from that moment to this, persuaded
that this object has been constantly solicited by their
Ministers at this Court.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I have every personal, as well as
public motive to recall to your Excellency's recollection, a
letter or memorial, which was presented to your Excellency
in the latter end of the month of December, 1778, or
the beginning of January, 1779, in which a great variety of
arguments were adduced to show, that it was not only good
policy, but absolutely necessary, to send a superiority of
naval force to the coasts of the Continent of America.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
This letter, together with your Excellency's answer, acknowledging
the receipt of it, I transmitted to Congress
myself, and their Journals show, that they received them
near a year ago, so that Congress I am persuaded, rest in
the most perfect security in the persuasion, that everything
has been done by themselves and their servants at this
Court, to obtain this measure, and that the necessary arrangements
of the King's naval service have hitherto prevented
it.</p>

<p>But if it was only suspected by Congress, that a direct application
from them to the King was expected, I am assured
they would not hesitate a moment to make it. I am so convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
by experience, of the absolute necessity of more
consultations and communications between his Majesty's
Ministers and the Ministers of Congress, that I am determined
to omit no opportunity of communicating my sentiments
to your Excellency, upon everything that appears
to me of importance to the common cause, in which I can
do it with propriety. And the communications shall be
direct in person, or by letter to your Excellency, without
the intervention of any third person. And I shall be very
happy, and think myself highly honored, to give my poor
opinion and advice to his Majesty's Ministers upon anything
that relates to the United States, or the common
cause, whenever they shall be asked.</p>

<p>I wish I may be mistaken, but it could answer no good
purpose to deceive myself; and I certainly will not disguise
my sentiments from your Excellency. I think that Admiral
Graves, with the ships before in America, will be able
to impede the operations of M. de Ternay, of M. de Rochambeau,
and of General Washington, if their plan is to
attack New York.</p>

<p>If there should be a naval battle between M. de Ternay
and Admiral Graves, the event is uncertain. From the
near equality of force, and the equality of bravery and of
naval science which now prevails everywhere, I think we
cannot depend upon anything decisive in such an engagement,
unless it be from the particular character of Graves,
whom I know personally to be neither a great man, nor a
great officer. If there should be no decision in a naval
battle, Graves and his fleet must lay at New York, and
M. de Ternay and his, at Rhode Island. I readily agree,
that this will be a great advantage to the common cause,
for the reasons mentioned in my letter to your Excellency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
of the 13th of this month. But still I beg leave to suggest
to your Excellency, whether it would not be for the good
of the common cause to have still further resources in
view, whether circumstances may not be such in the
West Indies, as to enable M. de Guichen to despatch
ships to the reinforcement of M. de Ternay, or whether it
may not consist with the King's service to despatch ships
from Europe for that purpose, and further, whether the
Court of Spain cannot be convinced of the policy of keeping
open the communication between the United States
and the French and Spanish Islands in the West Indies,
so as to co-operate with France and the United States in
the system of keeping up a constant superiority of naval
power, both upon the coasts of North America and in the
West India Islands. This is the true plan which is finally
to humble the English, and give the combined forces the
advantage.</p>

<p>The English, in the course of the last war, derived all
their triumphs, both upon the Continent of America and
the Islands, from the succors they received from their Colonies.
And I am sure that France and Spain, with attention
to the subject, may receive assistance in this war,
from the same source equally decisive.</p>

that Mr Franklin being the sole person who has letters of

<p>Besides, Sir, I ought to observe to you, that the passage
in my letter, which you have thought it your duty to consider

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, August 14th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 27th of July I set out from Paris on a journey to
Amsterdam. I left Mr Dana, and Mr Thaxter at Paris,
who will regularly transmit to Congress whatever shall
occur of importance to the United States to know. They
will also enclose all the English, French, and Dutch gazettes.
They are exerting themselves in this Republic to
man their ships of war, in which they have great success,
as they give very great premiums for seamen, as far as
sixty ducats a man. The Russian men-of-war are arrived
and anchored in sight of the Texel, and several of their
officers have been ashore in this city. The Plenipotentiaries
are gone to Petersburg. Sweden and Denmark
have adopted the declaration of Russia. It is whispered,
that the Dutch Ministers to the Congress at Petersburg
are shackled with instructions, to insist on a warranty of
their possessions in the East and West Indies, previous to
their acceding to the confederation of the maritime powers,
but this instruction produced a protest of the city of
Amsterdam, with such reasons against it, that it is thought
the opposite party will not venture to take upon themselves
the consequences of a refusal to join in the confederation;
so that it is expected the treaty will take place.</p>

<p>It is universally considered as a great misfortune to us,
by all whom I converse with here, that Mr Laurens is
not arrived. Some prudent person, authorised by Congress,
is earnestly desired here. He would not be publicly
received, at least until the States shall take a decided
part with the other maritime powers against England; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
case, however, may soon happen. But there is not in
Europe a better station to collect intelligence from France,
Spain, England, Germany, and all the northern parts, nor
a better situation, from whence to circulate intelligence
through all parts of Europe than this. And it may be depended
on, that our cause has never suffered from anything
more than from the failure of giving and receiving
intelligence. A Minister here, from Congress, would be
considered as the centre of communication between America
and this, and many other parts of Europe; and I have
since my arrival here, been more convinced than ever, that
Congress might open a considerable loan here, and be supplied
from hence with stores and with clothing, and at the
same time be gradually extending the commerce between
this country and America, to the great advantage of both.
I have had a great deal of conversation upon the subject
of a loan, and shall have more. I am sure that a loan
might be obtained by any one with powers from Congress.
But there are no powers as yet arrived in Europe that will
ever succeed here.</p>

<p>We are still in daily hope and expectation that Mr Laurens
will arrive; but should he decline to come, or in case
any accident has befallen him, I most earnestly recommend
to Congress the appointment of some other gentleman, with
a proper commission, with full powers and especially to
borrow money, and to sign proper promissory notes for the
payment of it.</p>

<p>The King of Sweden is at Spa, from whence in the letter
of the 30th of July the public are informed, that his
Majesty, the first who during the present maritime war has
given validity to the rights of neuters, by means of the
declaration which he caused to be made the last year to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the belligerent powers, and by means of the protection
which he granted from that time to the commerce and the
navigation of his subjects, in sending out from his ports a
numerous squadron, has manifested the consistency of his
sentiments and disposition in this respect, by a new declaration,
lately made to the Courts of Madrid, Versailles,
and London, an authentic copy of which here follows.</p>


<h4>DECLARATION OF SWEDEN.</h4>

<p>"From the commencement of the present war, the King
has taken care to make known his fashion of thinking to all
Europe; he has prescribed to himself a perfect neutrality;
he has discharged the duties of it with scrupulous exactness;
he has thought himself entitled to enjoy in consequence
of it the rights attached to the quality of a sovereign
absolutely neuter. Notwithstanding his trading subjects
have been obliged to demand his protection, and his
Majesty has found himself under a necessity of granting it
to them. To fulfil this object, the King caused to be
armed the last year a certain number of vessels; one part
of them he employed upon the coasts of his kingdom, and
the other has served to convoy the Swedish merchant vessels,
in the different seas where the commerce of his subjects
called them to navigate; he communicated these
measures to the belligerent powers, and he prepared himself
to continue them in the course of the present year,
when other Courts, which had equally adopted a neutrality,
communicated to him the dispositions which they had
made, conformable with those of the King, and tending to
the same end. The Empress of Russia caused to be presented
a declaration to the Courts of London, Versailles,
and Madrid, by which she informed them of the resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
she had taken to defend the commerce of her subjects,
and the universal rights of neutral nations. This declaration
was founded upon principles so just, that it did not
appear possible to call them in question. The King has
found them entirely conformable to his own cause, to the
treaty concluded in 1666, between Sweden and England,
and to that between Sweden and France; and his Majesty
has not been able to excuse himself from acknowledging
and adopting these same principles, not only with regard
to the powers with whom the said treaties are in
force, but also with relation to those who are already
involved in the present war, or who may become so in the
sequel, and with whom the King has no treaty to appeal to.
It is the universal law, and in default of particular engagements,
this becomes obligatory upon all nations. In consequence
of which, the King declares once more, that he
will observe in future the same neutrality, and with the
same exactness, which he has observed heretofore. He
will forbid his subjects, under severe penalties, to deviate
in any manner whatsoever from the duties which a similar
neutrality imposes; but he will protect their lawful commerce
by all means possible, when they shall conduct it
conformably to the principles abovementioned."</p>

<p>From Hamburg, the 1st of August, we have the following
article. "All nations and all commercial cities being
interested in the liberty of the seas and the safety of navigation,
attacked and violated in our days, in a manner
whereof history furnishes few examples, we have not learned
here with less joy than in the rest of Europe, (if we
except perhaps Great Britain,) the generous resolution
which the three Powers of the North have taken to protect,
by an armed neutrality, the commerce of their subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and at the same time the rights of all nations; rights immemorial,
which honor and justice alone ought to cause to be
respected, without having occasion to recur to the sanction
of treaties. The Court of Denmark has adopted these
principles into the declaration, which, after the example of
Russia, she has made to the belligerent powers, and which
is conceived in these terms."</p>


<h4>DECLARATION OF DENMARK.</h4>

<p>"If a neutrality the most exact and the most perfect,
with a navigation the most regular, and an inviolable respect
for treaties had been sufficient to place the freedom
of commerce of the subjects of the King of Denmark and
Norway in a state of safety from these misfortunes, which
ought to be unknown to nations which are at peace, and
who are free and independent, it would not be necessary
to take new measures to insure them this liberty to which
they have a right the most incontestible.</p>

<p>"The King of Denmark has always founded his glory
and his grandeur upon the esteem and the confidence of
other people; he has made it a law to himself, from the
commencement of his reign, to manifest to all the powers,
his friends, a conduct the most capable of convincing them
of his pacific sentiments, and of his sincere desire to contribute
to the general prosperity of Europe. His proceedings,
the most uniform and which nothing can conceal, are
a proof of this. He has not hitherto addressed himself,
but to the belligerent powers themselves, to obtain the redress
of his grievances; and he has never failed of moderation
in his demands, nor of gratitude when they have had
the success, which they ought to have. But the neutral
navigation has been too often molested, and the most innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
commerce of his subjects too frequently disturbed,
for the King not to think himself obliged to take at present
measures proper to assure to himself and to his allies, the
safety of commerce and navigation, and the maintenance
of the indispensable rights of liberty and independence.
If the duties of neutrality are sacred, if the law of nations
has also its decrees adopted by all impartial nations, established
by custom, and founded in equity and reason, an
independent and neutral nation does not lose by the war of
another the rights which it had before that war, because
that peace continues for her with all the belligerent people,
without receiving, and without having to follow, the laws of
any of them. She is authorised to make in all places,
(the contraband excepted) the traffic, which she would
have a right to make if peace existed in all Europe, as it
exists for her. The King pretends to nothing beyond
that which neutrality entitles him to. Such is his rule and
that of his people, and his Majesty not being able to avow
the principle, that a belligerent nation has a right to interrupt
the commerce of his States, he has thought it a duty,
which he owed to himself and to his people, faithful observers
of his regulations, and to the powers at war themselves,
to lay open to them the following principles, which
he has always had, and which he will always avow, and
maintain in concert with her Majesty the Empress of all
the Russias, whose sentiments he acknowledges to be entirely
conformable to his own.</p>

<p>"1st. That neutral vessels may navigate freely from
port to port, and upon the coasts of nations at war.</p>

<p>"2d. That the effects belonging to the subjects of the
powers at war may be free upon neutral vessels, excepting
merchandises of contraband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>"3d. That nothing be understood by this denomination
of contraband, but that which is expressly defined as
such in the third article of the Treaty of Commerce with
Great Britain, in 1770, and in the twentysixth and twentyseventh
articles of his treaty of commerce with France, in
1742; and the King will equally avow that, which is fixed
in these articles towards the powers, with which he has no
treaty.</p>

<p>"4th. That we should consider as a port blocked, that
into which no vessel can enter without an evident danger,
by reason of ships of war, stationed to form very near an
effectual blockade.</p>

<p>"5th. That these principles serve as a rule, in all proceedings,
and that justice be rendered with despatch and
according to the documents of the sea, conformably to
treaties and to received usages.</p>

<p>"His Majesty does not hesitate to declare, that he
will maintain these principles, as well as the honor of
his flag, and the liberty and independence of commerce,
and of the navigation of his subjects; and it is to this end,
that he has caused to be armed a part of his fleet, although
he desires to preserve with all the powers at war, not only
the good intelligence, but even all the intimacy, which a
neutrality can admit. The King will never deviate from
this, without being forced; he knows the duties and the
obligations of it; he respects them as much as his treaties,
and desires nothing but to maintain them. His Majesty is
also persuaded, that the belligerent powers will do justice to
these motives; that they will be as far as he is himself
from everything, which oppresses the natural liberty of
men, and that they will give to their Admiralties and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
their officers, orders conformable to the principles here announced,
which evidently tend to the prosperity and the
interest of all Europe.</p>

<h3>TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, August 17th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I was never more amused with political speculations,
than since my arrival in this country. Every one has his
prophecy, and every prophecy is a paradox. One says,
America will give France the go-by. Another, that
France and Spain will abandon America. A third, that
Spain will forsake France and America. A fourth, that
America has the interest of all Europe against her. A
fifth, that she will become the greatest manufacturing country,
and thus ruin Europe. A sixth, that she will become a
great military and naval power, and will be very ambitious,
and so terrible to Europe. In short, it seems, as if they
had studied for every impossibility, and agreed to foretell
it, as a probable future event.</p>

<p>I tell the first, that if the King of France would release
America from her treaty, and England would agree to our
independence, on condition we would make an alliance
offensive and defensive with her, America ought not to accept
it, and would not, because she will in future have no
security for peace, even with England, but in her treaty
with France. I ask the second, whether he thinks the
connexion of America of so little consequence to France
and Spain, that they would lightly give it up. I ask the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
third, whether the family compact added to the connexion
with America, is a trifling consideration to Spain. To the
fifth, I say, that America will not make manufactures
enough for her own consumption these thousand years.
And to the sixth, that we love peace, and hate war so
much, that we can scarcely keep up an army necessary to
defend ourselves against the greatest of evils, and to secure
our independence, which is the greatest of blessings; and,
therefore, while we have land enough to conquer from the
trees and rocks and wild beasts, we shall never go abroad
to trouble other nations.</p>

<p>To the fourth I say, that their paradox is like several
others, viz, that Bacchus and Ceres did mischief to mankind,
when they invented wine and bread; that arts,
sciences, and civilization have been general calamities, &amp;c.
That upon their supposition, all Europe ought to agree
to bring away the inhabitants of America, and divide them
among the nations of Europe, to be maintained as paupers,
leaving America to be overgrown again with trees and
bushes, and to become again the habitations of bears and
Indians, forbidding all navigation to that quarter of the
world in future. That mankind in general, however, are
probably of a different opinion, believing that Columbus,
as well as Bacchus and Ceres, did a service to mankind,
and that Europe and America will be rich blessings to
each other, the one supplying a surplus of manufactures,
and the other a surplus of raw materials, the productions
of agriculture.</p>

<p>It is very plain, however, that speculation and disputation
can do us little service. No facts are believed, but decisive
military conquests; no arguments are seriously
attended to in Europe but force. It is to be hoped, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
countrymen, instead of amusing themselves any longer with
delusive dreams of peace, will bend the whole force of
their minds to augment their navy, to find out their own
strength and resources, and to depend upon themselves.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, August 22d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>In a letter of the 14th instant, I had the honor to transmit
to Congress the declaration of the Courts of Sweden
and Denmark, conformable to that of Russia, which have
been presented to the belligerent powers. I now send the
answer of the King of France to the declaration of Sweden.
It is conceived in these terms.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Answer of France to the Declaration of Sweden.</em></p>

<p>"The King has constantly desired, that the neutral
powers should not receive any damage by the war in
which his Majesty is engaged; his orders have assured to
the vessels belonging to these powers the enjoyment of all
the liberty, which the laws of the sea allow them; and if
any individual navigators have had cause to complain of
having suffered by the violence of the subjects of his Majesty,
he has rendered them immediate and ample justice.</p>

<p>His Majesty has seen with satisfaction in the declaration
which has been presented to him, on behalf of the King of
Sweden, that it was the intention of this Prince, to continue
to protect the navigation of his subjects against all
violence; that even his Swedish Majesty had resolved to
take measures, in concert with other Courts, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with the Empress of Russia, to accomplish more effectually
this purpose. The King cannot but wish, that the confederation
of his Swedish Majesty with those powers, may
produce the benefit which they promise themselves from
it; that the ocean may be free, conformably to the law of
nations and to treaties, which are known to be nothing
more than explanations of that law; and, in fine, that all
the nations who have no part in the war, may not suffer
the evils of it. His Majesty has renewed to the officers of
his marine, and to the privateers which carry his flag,
orders entirely conformable to the principles, upon which
must depend the safety and tranquillity of all neutral
vessels. For a stronger reason still, the subjects of the
King of Sweden ought to be assured, that they will meet
with no obstruction from those of his Majesty, since there
is no Frenchman, who is ignorant of the alliance and
friendship, which has so long subsisted between the two
Crowns.</p>

<p>"The precautions which his Swedish Majesty has taken,
as they must confine the Swedish navigators within the
bounds of the most exact neutrality, so they will be a new
motive for them to demand the execution of those laws, of
which their master discovers himself to be a zealous defender;
laws, which the King ardently wishes to see
adopted by the unanimous concurrence of all the powers,
in such a manner, that no one may have to suffer by the
war, if his sovereign does not take a part in it, provided he
shall conform to the rules prescribed, to prevent all abuse
of the neutral flag. Versailles, 4th of August, 1780."</p>

<p>In a London paper of the 15th of August, are the following
queries of the Court of Sweden, relative to the proposal,
which the Court of Russia has made for the reciprocal
protection and navigation of their subjects.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span><em>Queries of the Court of Sweden.</em></p>

<p>"1st. How, and in what manner, a reciprocal protection
and mutual assistance shall be given?</p>

<p>"2d. Whether each particular power shall be obliged to
protect the general commerce of, the whole, or if, in the
meantime, it may employ a part of its armament in the
protection of its own particular commerce?</p>

<p>"3d. If several of their combined squadrons should
meet, or, for example, one or more of their vessels, what
shall be the rule of their conduct towards each other, and
how far shall the neutral protection extend?</p>

<p>"4th. It seems essential to agree upon the manner, in
which representations shall be made to the powers at war,
if, notwithstanding our measures, their ships of war, or
armed vessels, should continue to interrupt our commerce
in any manner; must these remonstrances be made in the
general name of the united powers, or shall each particular
power plead its own cause only?</p>

<p>"5th. Lastly, it appears essentially necessary to provide
against this possible event, where one of the united powers
seeing itself driven to extremities, against any of the powers
actually at war, should claim the assistance of the allies in
this convention to do her justice, in what manner can this
be best concerted? A circumstance, which equally requires
a stipulation that the reprisals in that case shall not be at
the will of such party injured, but that the common voice
shall decide; otherwise, an individual power might at its
pleasure draw the rest against their inclinations and interests
into disagreeable extremities, or break the whole
league, and reduce matters into their original state, which
would render the whole fruitless and of none effect."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span><em>Answer of the Court of Russia.</em></p>

<p>"1st. As to the manner in which protection and mutual
assistance shall be granted, it must be settled by a
formal convention, to which all the neutral powers will be
invited, the principal end of which is, to ensure a free navigation
to the merchants ships of all nations. Whenever
such vessel shall have proved from its papers, that it carries
no contraband goods, the protection of a squadron or
vessels of war shall be granted her, under whose care she
shall put herself, and which shall prevent her being interrupted.
From hence it follows;</p>

<p>"2d. That each power must concur in the general security
of commerce; in the meantime, the better to accomplish
this object, it will be necessary to settle, by means of
a separate article, the places and distances which may be
judged proper for the station of each power. From that
method will arise this advantage, that all the squadrons of
the allies will form a kind of chain, and be able to assist
each other; the particular arrangements to be confined
only to the knowledge of the allies, though the convention
in all other points will be communicated to the powers at
war, accompanied with all the protestations of a strict
neutrality.</p>

<p>"3d. It is undoubtedly the principle of a perfect equality
which must regulate this point. We shall follow the
common mode with regard to safety; in case the squadrons
should meet and engage, the commanders will conform
to the usages of the sea service, because, as is
observed above, the reciprocal protection under these
conditions should be unlimited.</p>

<p>"4th. It seems expedient, that the representations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
mentioned in this article be made by the party aggrieved,
and that the Ministers of the other confederate powers
support those remonstrances in the most forcible and efficacious
manner.</p>

<p>"5th. We feel all the importance of this consideration,
and to render it clear, it is necessary to distinguish the
case. If any one of the allied powers should suffer itself
to be drawn in by motives contrary to the established principles
of a neutrality and perfect impartiality, should injure
its laws, or extend their bounds, it cannot certainly be expected
that others should espouse the quarrel; on the
contrary, such a conduct would be deemed an abandoning
the ties which unite them. But if the insult offered to one
of the allies should be hostile to the principles adopted and
announced in the face of all Europe, or should be marked
with the character of hatred and animosity, inspired by resentment
at these common measures of the confederacy,
which have no other tendency than to make, in a precise
and irrecoverable manner, laws for the liberty of commerce,
and the rights of every neutral nation, then it shall
be held indispensable for the united powers to make a
common cause of it, (at sea only) without its being a
groundwork for other operations, as these connexions are
purely maritime, having no other object than naval commerce
and navigation. From all that is said above, it
evidently results, that the common will of all, founded
upon the principles admitted and adopted by the contracting
parties, must alone decide, and that it will always be the
fixed basis of the conduct and operations of this union.
Finally, we shall observe, that these conventions suppose
no other naval armament than what shall be conformable
to circumstances, according as these shall render them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
necessary, or as may be agreed. It is probable, that this
agreement, once ratified and established, will be of the
greatest consequence; and that the belligerent powers
will find in it sufficient motives to persuade them to respect
the neutral flag, and prevent their provoking the
resentment of a respectable communion, founded under the
auspices of the most evident justice, and the sole idea of
which is received with the universal applause of all impartial
Europe."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, August 23d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The errand of Mr Cumberland to Madrid is a mere
finesse of the British Ministry, intended to aid the stockjobbers
to keep up the stocks, aid the loan, and the canvass
for an election, and lull the belligerent powers, while they
prepare their measures for future enterprises and another
campaign. They have carried this plot so far, that I see
some paragraphs in the foreign papers, which seem intended
to counteract it.</p>

<p>The truth is, according to my information, that orders
are already sent out by the British cabinet to prosecute the
war with vigor in North Carolina and Virginia, the ensuing
fall, winter, and spring. General Prevost is about to sail
with some frigates to aid their operations on Cape Fear
river. It is said at the same time, that they are sounding
the House of Bourbon through Sardinia, and have made
some loose propositions of accommodation, the groundwork
of which is the sacrifice of America; and there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
doubt they would yield to France and Spain very great
things to carry their point against America, who may depend
upon the utmost exertions of their malice and revenge.
But all this will not do. France and Spain are
now responsible for their conduct to the rest of Europe,
especially the Northern powers; and besides this, the separation
between America and England is an object of
more pressing importance to France and Spain, than
any concessions that England can make them. So that
America need not be under any apprehensions of being
deserted.</p>

<p>If, however, she were to be deserted by all the world,
she ought seriously to maintain her resolution to be free.
She has the means within herself. Her greatest misfortune
has been, that she has never yet felt her full strength,
nor considered the extent of her resources.</p>

<p>I cannot but lament, however, that there is no representation
of Congress in this Republic, vested with powers to
borrow money. This would be a double advantage. We
should avail ourselves of a loan, and at the same time
lessen the loan of England. A loan once begun here,
would rapidly increase, so as to deprive the English of this
resource. This is the method in which commerce may be
extended between the two Republics, and the political sentiments
and system of Holland changed. I fancy that several
very heavy and solid houses here might be persuaded to
become security for the payment of interest, and that contracts
might be made with them to send them remittances
in produce, either to Europe, St Eustatia, St Thomas,
&amp;c., to enable them to discharge the interest. Might not
merchants be found in Philadelphia, Boston, and many
other places, who would enter into contract with the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
to remit such a sum as should be agreed on, in the produce
of the country to such houses here? This method, if
Congress should think it expedient to fall into the way of
sending fleets of merchantmen under convoy, would easily
succeed. The safe arrival of the Fier Roderique, with so
large a number of vessels under her care, gives great encouragement
to the plan.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>I have the pleasure to write to Congress news, which I
hope they will receive many other ways before this letter
can arrive, viz.; that the outward bound British West India
fleet of fiftytwo sail and five East Indiamen, on the 9th
of August, fell in with the combined French and Spanish
fleets, about sixty leagues from Cape St Vincents, and
were most of them taken; the frigates which composed the
convoy and four of the West Indiamen alone having escaped.
This is the account. We may possibly hear of some
deductions, but the account in general is authentic, and of
very great importance, as the value of the property is large,
the number of soldiers and seamen considerable, and the
disappointment to the fleets and armies of our enemies in
the East and West Indies and in North America, not to be
repaired.</p>

<p>This news has been from the 22d of August to the 3d
of September in travelling from London to Amsterdam,
where it makes a very great sensation indeed. We had, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, September 5th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>As eloquence is cultivated with more care in free Republics
than in other governments, it has been found by
constant experience that such Republics have produced
the greatest purity, copiousness and perfection of language.
It is not to be disputed, that the form of government has
an influence upon language, and language in its turn influences
not only the form of government, but the temper,
the sentiments, and manners of the people. The admirable
models which have been transmitted through the world,
and continued down to these days, so as to form an essential
part of the education of mankind from generation to
generation, by those two ancient towns, Athens and Rome,
would be sufficient without any other argument to show
the United States the importance to their liberty, prosperity,
and glory, of an early attention to the subject of eloquence
and language.</p>

<p>Most of the nations of Europe have thought it necessary
to establish by public authority, institutions for fixing and
improving their proper languages. I need not mention the
academies in France, Spain, and Italy, their learned labors,
nor their great success. But it is very remarkable, that
although many learned and ingenious men in England
have from age to age projected similar institutions for correcting
and improving the English tongue, yet the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
have never found time to interpose in any manner;
so that to this day there is no grammar nor dictionary extant
of the English language, which has the least public
authority, and it is only very lately, that a tolerable dictionary
has been published, even by a private person, and
there is not yet a passable grammar enterprised by any
individual.</p>

<p>The honor of forming the first public institution for refining,
correcting, improving, and ascertaining the English
language, I hope is reserved for Congress; they have every
motive that can possibly influence a public assembly to
undertake it. It will have a happy effect upon the union
of the States to have a public standard for all persons in
every part of the Continent to appeal to, both for the signification
and pronunciation of the language. The constitutions
of all the States in the Union are so democratical,
that eloquence will become the instrument, for recommending
men to their fellow citizens, and the principal means of
advancement through the various ranks and offices of society.</p>

<p>In the last century, Latin was the universal language of
Europe. Correspondence among the learned, and indeed
among merchants and men of business, and the conversation
of strangers and travellers, was generally carried on in that
dead language. In the present century, Latin has been
generally laid aside, and French has been substituted in its
place; but has not yet become universally established, and
according to present appearances, it is not probable that it
will. English is destined to be, in the next and succeeding
centuries more generally the language of the world, than
Latin was in the last, or French is in the present age.
The reason of this is obvious, because the increasing population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
in America, and their universal connexion and correspondence
with all nations will, aided by the influence of
England in the world, whether great or small, force their
language into general use, in spite of all the obstacles that
may be thrown in their way, if any such there should be.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enlarge further, to show the motives
which the people of America have to turn their
thoughts early to this subject; they will naturally occur to
Congress in a much greater detail than I have time to hint
at. I would therefore submit to the consideration of Congress,
the expediency and policy of erecting, by their authority,
a society under the name of "The American Academy,
for refining, improving, and ascertaining the English
Language." The authority of Congress is necessary to
give such a society reputation, influence, and authority,
through all the States, and with other nations. The number
of members of which it shall consist, the manner of appointing
those members, whether each State shall have a
certain number of members, and the power of appointing
them, or whether Congress shall appoint them, whether
after the first appointment, the society itself shall fill up
vacancies, these, and other questions, will easily be determined
by Congress.</p>

<p>It will be necessary, that the society should have a
library, consisting of a complete collection of all writings
concerning languages of every sort, ancient and modern.
They must have some officers, and some other expenses,
which will make some small funds indispensably necessary.
Upon a recommendation from Congress, there is no doubt
but the Legislature of every State in the confederation
would readily pass a law, making such a society a body
politic, enable it to sue, and be sued, and to hold an estate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
real or personal, of a limited value in that State. I have
the honor to submit these hints to the consideration of
Congress.</p>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, September 19th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, Mr Dana arrived here from
Paris, with the despatches which came by Mr Searle.</p>

<p>I am very sensible of the honor that is done me by this
appointment, and yesterday morning I set myself seriously
about discharging the duties of it, and this day I have been
some leagues into the country upon the same service.
There are good reasons for concealing the names of the
gentlemen to whom I have applied for advice and assistance,
but they are such as Congress, I think, would have
approved if they had themselves been here.</p>

<p>I was told very candidly, that I might possibly be much
mistaken in my information; that, possibly, I might think
that money was more plenty here than it is; that America
had more friends than she has; and that the difficulty of negotiating
a loan here was less than it is; that it was mysterious
that Congress should empower any gentleman to negotiate a
loan, without, at the same time, empowering the same, or
some other, to negotiate a political treaty of alliance and
commerce, consistent with the treaties already made with
other powers; that a Minister Plenipotentiary here, would
be advised to apply directly to the Prince and the States-General;
that he would not be affronted or ill treated by
either, and whether received publicly or not, would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
courted by many respectable individuals, and would greatly
facilitate a loan.</p>

<p>I was, however, encouraged to hope, that I might have
some small success, and was advised to a particular course
in order to obtain it, that cannot as yet be communicated.
I must, however, apprize Congress, that there are many
delicate questions, which it becomes my duty to determine
in a short time, and perhaps none of more difficulty than
what house shall be applied to, or employed. I have
no affections or aversions to influence me in the choice.
And shall not depend upon my own judgment alone, without
the advice of such persons as Congress will one day
know to be respectable. But offence will probably be
taken, let the choice fall upon whom it may, by several
other houses, that have pretensions and undoubted merit.
As this may occasion censure and complaints, I only ask
of Congress not to judge of those complaints without hearing
my reasons, and this request I presume I need not
make. I have only to add, that the moment Mr Laurens
shall arrive, or any other gentleman, vested with the same
commission, I will render him every service in my power,
and communicate to him every information I may possess.</p>

<p>But I ought not to conclude without giving my opinion,
that it is absolutely necessary that Mr Laurens, or whoever
comes in his place, should have a commission of
Minister Plenipotentiary. If that gentleman was now here
with such a commission, it would have more influence
than perhaps anybody in America can imagine, upon the
conduct of this Republic, upon the Congress at Petersburg,
and upon the success of Mr Jay, at Madrid.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, September 16th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to send by this opportunity a few pamphlets
and papers. The pamphlets relate to subjects which
interest the United States, and therefore ought to be communicated
to Congress for their consideration.</p>

<p>The attention of mankind is now turned, next to the
Congress of America, upon that at Petersburg. The last
letters from London say that they have information, that
one of the first measures of this confederation will be an
acknowledgment of American independence. Whether
this is true or not, I am not able to say. The councils of
the sovereigns of Europe are not easily penetrated; but it
is our duty to attend to them, and throw into view such
information as may be in our power, that they take no
measures inconsistent with their and our interest for want
of light, a misfortune that may easily happen. In this
view, I could wish that the United States had a minister at
each of the maritime Courts, I mean Holland, Russia,
Sweden, and Denmark, and, as the Cabinet of Berlin has
much influence in the politics of Europe, Prussia. I say
this upon supposition, that Congress can devise means of
defraying the expense, which to be sure amounts to a large
sum.</p>

<p>I have heard that Mr Searle has arrived at Brest, but
am not informed of his destination, nor whether he has
despatches for me. I am anxious to learn from Congress
what their intentions may be respecting me, I have as
yet received no authority to draw upon any fund whatsoever
for my subsistence, nor to borrow money for that or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
any other purpose. I see no prospect of my commission
being of any utility. Although many persons here think
that peace will be made in the course of the ensuing winter
or spring, yet I must confess I am of a different opinion.
The idea, that France will dictate the conditions of
peace, if it is made now, cannot be borne by Englishmen as
yet, they are not yet sufficiently humbled, although probably
every year will add some fresh humiliation to the demands
upon their country. The English privateers have
taken some Russian vessels loaded with hemp and iron,
which must bring the question to a legal decision. The
Admiralty will probably discharge them, and the Ministry
will give up the point of free ships making free goods, provided
the Dutch agree with the Northern Powers, for they
will not venture upon a war with all the world at once.
Besides the military force, which they could not stand
against, they would not be able to obtain any stores for
their navy. But the great question now is, whether the
Dutch will agree. Their deputies are instructed to insist
upon a warranty of their East and West India dominions.
Whether the Northern Powers will agree to this condition,
is a question. The States-General, however, are sitting,
and will wait for despatches from Petersburg, and will
probably be much governed by events. What events have
happened in the West Indies and North America we shall
soon learn.</p>

<p>Digby has sailed with a part of Geary's late fleet,
whether for another expedition to Gibraltar, or whether
for the West Indies or North America, is unknown. The
success of these operations will probably influence much
the deliberations both at Petersburg and the Hague. This
time only can discover. It is said, however, that M. Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Texier will be exempted by the States-General from the
payment of duties upon his masts, hemp, iron, and other
naval stores that he is sending over land, to the French
Marine. The capture of fiftyfive ships at once, so much
wealth, so many seamen and soldiers, and such quantities
of stores, is a severe stroke to the English, and cannot but
have the most excellent effects for us, both in the West
Indies and North America. The right vein is now opened,
and I hope that the Courts of France and Spain will now
be in earnest in convoying their own commerce and cruising
for that of their enemies. This is a short, easy, and
infallible method of humbling the English, preventing the
effusion of an ocean of blood, and bringing the war to a conclusion.
In this policy, I hope our countrymen will join,
with the utmost alacrity. Privateering is as well understood
by them as any people whatsoever; and it is by cutting
off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I
expect deliverance from enemies. And I should be wanting
in my duty, if I did not warn them against any relaxation
of their exertions by sea or land, from a fond expectation
of peace. They will deceive themselves if they depend
upon it. Never, never will the English make peace
while they have an army in North America.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, September 24th, 1780.</p>
<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Since the receipt of the despatches from Congress,
brought by Mr Searle, I have been uninterruptedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
employed in attempting to carry into execution their
designs.</p>

<p>The first inquiry which arose in my own mind was, whether
it was prudent to make any communication of my business
to the States-General or to the Prince. Considering that
my errand was simply an affair of credit, and that I had no
political authority whatsoever, I thought, and upon consulting
gentlemen of the most knowledge, best judgment, and
most undoubted inclination for a solid and lasting connexion
between the two Republics, I found them of the same
opinion, that it was best to keep my designs secret as long
as I could.</p>

<p>I then inquired whether it would be proper to communicate
anything to the Regency of Amsterdam, or any branch
of government whatsoever; and I was advised against it,
and to proceed to endeavor to effect a loan upon the simple
foundation of private credit. I have accordingly made
all the inquiries possible, for the best and most unexceptionable
House. Tomorrow I expect an answer to some
propositions which I made yesterday.</p>

<p>This business must all be settled with so much secrecy
and caution, and I am under so many difficulties, not understanding
the Dutch language, and the gentlemen I have
to do with not being much more expert in French than I
am myself, and not understanding English at all, that the
business goes on slower than I could wish. Commodore
Gillon, by his knowledge of Dutch and general acquaintance
here, has been as useful to me as he has been
friendly.</p>

<p>I never saw the national benefit of a fine language generally
read and spoken in so strong a light as since I have
been here. The Dutch language is understood by nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
but themselves, the consequence of which has been, that
this nation is not known. With as profound learning and
ingenuity as any people in Europe, they have been overlooked,
because they were situated among others more
numerous and powerful than they. I hope that Congress
will take warning by their example, and do everything in
their power to make the language they speak, respectable
throughout the world. Separated as we are from the
Kingdom of Great Britain, we have not made war upon
the English language any more than against the old English
character. An academy instituted by the authority of
Congress for correcting, improving, and fixing the English
language, would strike Great Britain with envy, and all
the rest of the world with admiration. The labors of such
a society would unite all America in the same language,
for thirty millions of Americans to speak to all the nations
of the earth by the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, September 25th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>There are some persons in this Republic who have been
attentive to this war, and who know somewhat of the history
of the rise and progress of the United States of America,
but it is astonishing that the number should be so small.
Even in the city of Amsterdam, which is the most attentive
to our affairs, and the best inclined towards us, there
are few persons who do not consider the American resistance
as a desultory rage of a few enthusiasts, without order,
discipline, law, or government. There are scarcely any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
that have an adequate idea of the numbers, the increasing
population, or the growing commerce of America.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival here, some gentlemen were inquisitive
about our forms of government. I asked if they had seen
them in print; I was answered, no. Upon this I made it
my business to search in all the booksellers' shops for a collection
of American Constitutions, which was published in
French two or three years ago, but could find only two
copies, which I presented to the gentlemen who made the
inquiry. Nothing would serve our cause more than having
a complete edition of all the American Constitutions
correctly printed in English at Philadelphia, by order of
Congress, and sent to Europe, as well as sold in America.
The Rhode Island and Connecticut Constitutions ought not
to be omitted, although they have undergone no alteration;
and it would be well to print the Confederation in the same
volume. This volume would be read by everybody in
Europe who reads English, and could obtain it, and some
would even learn English for the sake of reading it; it
would be translated into every language of Europe, and
would fix the opinion of our unconquerability more than
anything could, except driving the enemy wholly from the
United States.</p>

<p>There has been nobody here of sufficient information
and consideration to turn the attention of the public towards
our affairs, to communicate from time to time to the public,
in a language that is understood, intelligence from England,
France or America; but on the contrary, there have been
persons enough employed and well paid by our enemies,
to propagate misinformation, misrepresentation, and abuse.</p>

<p>The ancient and intimate connexion between the Houses
of Orange and Brunswick, the family alliances, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
vast advantage which the Princes of Orange have derived
in erecting, establishing, and perpetuating the Stadtholder
against the inclination of the republican party, and the reliance
which this family still has upon the same connexion
to support it, have attached the executive power of this
government in such a manner to England, that nothing but
necessity could make a separation. On the contrary, the
republican party, which has heretofore been conducted by
Barnevelt, Grotius, the De Witts and other immortal patriots,
have ever leaned towards an alliance with France because
she has ever favored the republican form of government
in this nation. All parties however agree, that England
has been ever jealous and envious of the Dutch commerce,
and done it great injuries; that this country is more
in the power of France if she were hostile, than of England,
and that her trade with France is of vastly greater
value than that with England. Yet England has more influence
here than France. The Dutch, some of them at
least, now see another commercial and maritime power
arising, which it is their interest to form an early connexion
with. All parties here see that it is not their interest
that France and Spain should secure too many advantages
in America, and too great a share in her commerce, and
especially in the fisheries in her seas. All parties too see
that it would be dangerous to the commerce, and even Independence
of the United Provinces, to have America
again under the dominion of England, and the republicans
see, or think they see, that a change in this government
and a loss of their liberties would be the consequence of
it too.</p>

<p>Amidst all these conflicts of interests and parties, and all
these speculations, the British Ambassador, with his swarms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of agents, is busily employed in propagating reports, in
which they are much assisted by those who are called here
Stadtholderians, and there has been nobody to contradict
or explain anything. This should be the business in part
of a Minister Plenipotentiary. Such a Minister, however,
would not have it in his power to do it effectually, without
frequent and constant information from Congress. At
present this nation is so ignorant of the strength, resources,
commerce, and constitution of America, it has so false and
exaggerated an imagination of the power of England, it has
so many doubts of our final success, so many suspicions of
our falling finally into the hands of France and Spain, so
many jealousies that France and Spain will abandon us, or
that we shall abandon them, so many fears of offending the
English Ministry, the English Ambassador, the great
mercantile houses, that are very profitably employed by
both, and above all, the Stadtholder and his friends, that
even a loan of money will meet with every obstruction and
discouragement possible. These chimeras, and many
more, are held up to the people, and influence their minds
and conduct to such a degree, that no man dares openly
and publicly disregard them.</p>

<p>I have this day received an answer to some propositions,
which I made last Saturday to a very respectable house,
declining to accept the trust proposed. I do not, however,
despair; I still hope to obtain something; but I am fully
persuaded, that without a commission of Minister Plenipotentiary,
and without time and care to lead the public
opinion into the truth, no man living will ever succeed, to
any large amount. Those persons, who wish to lend us
money, and are able to lend us any considerable sum, are
the patriots, who are willing to risk the resentment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
British and the Stadtholder, for the sake of extending the
commerce, strengthening the political interest, and preserving
the liberties of their country. They think, that
lending us money without forming a political connexion
with us will answer these ends. That cause stands very
insecurely, which rests on the shoulders of patriotism in
any part of Europe. But in such case, if patriotism is left
in a state of doubt whether she ought to sustain it, the
cause must fall to the ground.</p>

<p>On the 5th of this month, the Barons of Wassenaar and
Heekeren, Ministers Plenipotentiary of the States-General,
had their first audience of the Empress of Russia, presented
their letters of credit, and were graciously received.
The Baron de Wassenaar, in presenting his letters of
credit, addressed to the Empress the following speech.</p>

<p class="open">
"Madam,

<p>"The States-General, our masters, having received with
a lively gratitude the invitation, which your Imperial Majesty
has been so good as to make to them to take in concert
with you the measures the most proper and the most
effectual for the maintenance of the rights of their respective
subjects, and of the dignity of their States, have
thought, that they could not answer thereto with more
promptitude than by ordering us to your Court, to the end
to endeavor to conclude a project as great as it is just and
equitable, the honor of which is solely due to your Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>

<p>"Their High Mightinesses will esteem themselves happy,
if they may, on this occasion, strengthen still further, and
by indissoluble ties the union, which already subsists between
your empire and their Republic, and make themselves
regarded by you as your most faithful and sincere
allies, while they shall always esteem it an honor to give
marks of the respectful regard and perfect veneration,
which they have for your person, and eminent qualities.
Our wishes will be complete, Madam, if in succeeding
to serve our masters in so desirable an object, and upon
which they have founded the greatest hopes, our Ministry
might be agreeable to you, and procure us the approbation
and the high benevolence of your Imperial
Majesty."</p>

<p>The Empress made to this discourse a very gracious
answer, in saying, that it was very agreeable to her,
that their High Mightinesses considered the project upon
this footing, and that she should act, in this affair, by giving
proofs of the rectitude of which she discovered in all her
actions.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 6th of September, the Baron de Wassenaar
Starenburg, and the Baron de Heekeren Brantzenburg,
Ministers Plenipotentiary of their High Mightinesses, the
States-General of the United Provinces, had their first
audience of their Imperial Highnesses, the Grand Duke
and the Grand Duchess, and the Baron de Wassenaar
Starenburg had the honor to address, on this occasion, to
the Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess the following
discourse.</p>

<p class="open">
"My Lord Duke,
</p>

<p>"The States, our masters, in sending us to the Court of
her Imperial Majesty, your august mother, have directed
us at the same time, to renew to your Imperial Highness
the assurances of their most perfect consideration, and
their respectful regards. The harmony and good understanding,
which have subsisted between this Empire and
their Republic, make them hope, that your Imperial Highness
will be so good as to support with your credit the
object, which makes the subject of their Mission, and
thereby give to their High Mightinesses a new mark of the
friendship, with which you have always honored them, and
of which they will be zealous in all circumstances to ensure
the continuance. Permit, My Lord Duke, that after
having acquitted ourselves of these orders of our masters,
we may have the honor to recommend our Ministry and
our persons to the high benevolence of your Imperial
Highness."</p>

<p>The Baron de Wassenaar then addressed himself to the
Grand Duchess in the following terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p class="open">
"Madam,
</p>

<p>"Their High Mightinesses the States-General, our masters,
in accrediting us at the Court of her Imperial Majesty,
your august mother, have also commanded us to assure
your Imperial Highness of their most respectful sentiments,
and of the interest, which they will not cease to take in
everything, which may contribute to your prosperity, and
that of your Imperial House. Permit us, Madam, to
recommend ourselves to the precious benevolence of your
Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>The Grand Duke answered, "that nothing could be
more agreeable to him, than to see those Ministers Plenipotentiary
acquit themselves happily of their commission,
that to this end he should not fail to support it as far as
should be in his power, as he considered the Republic as
the first ally of the Empire; charging them to write this
to their High Mightinesses as his sincere sentiments."</p>

<p>On the 6th of September the Prince of Prussia arrived,
and made a magnificent entry into the city of Petersburg.</p>

<p>Last night I had a letter from M. Dumas, at the Hague,
dated the 3d of October, in which he writes, that a courier
had arrived from their Plenipotentiaries at Petersburg, with
despatches, which take away all plausible pretext from the
temporisers, for delaying the accession of the Republic to
the armed neutrality; that according to appearances, the
Emperor, the Kings of Prussia and Portugal would accede
to it likewise, and that all would agree in a maritime code,
which should be useful to all for the future.</p>

<p>But this intelligence is so general, and has the air of
being so conjectural, that I know not how much dependence
is to be had upon it.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, October 11th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It may serve to let Congress into the springs and motives
which actuate this Republic, to be furnished with the
following sketch of the Constitution, so far as it respects
the authority of the Stadtholder.</p>

<p>"The seven Provinces of the Low Countries, formerly
fiefs of the German Empire, but now for near two centuries
so strictly united and confederated by the celebrated
treaty of Utrecht, were before their union long governed
by Dukes, Earls, Bishops, and other Lords, who with a
limited power were the sovereigns of them. When this
country fell to the house of Burgundy, and afterwards to
that of Austria, these princes in their own absence, established
here Stadtholders or Governors, to whom they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
obliged to give ample powers. These Stadtholders or
Lieutenants had the administration of government, and
presided in the courts of justice, the department of which
was not then confined to judge of the law-suits of the citizens,
but extended itself to affairs of State, in which the
States themselves had little to do under the last Earls, who
did not consult them, but when there was a question concerning
taxes, or the safety of navigation and the fishery, and
when it was necessary for such purposes to raise money.</p>

<p>"The Stadtholders also took an oath to the States, by
which they promised to maintain their fundamental laws
and their privileges; at the inauguration of Princes, they
received their oath at the same time with the States of the
Provinces of which they were Stadtholders.</p>

<p>"It was upon this footing that William the First, Prince
of Orange, was made Governor and Lieutenant-General of
Holland, Zealand, and Utrecht, by Philip the Second,
when he was upon his departure for Spain. This commission
is dated the 9th of August, 1559. It contains among
other things, 'We establish him in the state of Governor
and Lieutenant-General of our counties of Holland, of
Zealand, of the country of Utrecht, West Friesland,
Voorne and the Brille, lands adjacent and annexed to our
said Earldoms of Holland and Zealand.' The troubles
arising soon after, he accomplished in 1576 a particular
union between Holland and Zealand, the States of which
conferred upon him as far as in them lay, the sovereign
authority for all the time that these two Provinces should
be at war and in arms, as the former had invested him
with the same authority the year before.</p>

<p>"In 1581, the same thing was repeated by Holland, and
soon after by Zealand; and in 1584, already elected Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
of Holland upon certain conditions, &mdash;&mdash; he would
have been invested with the sovereignty in all its forms, if
he had not been assassinated by a villain hired and set to
work by the Court of Spain. During the troubles, the
States declared more than once, that they acknowledged
the Prince of Orange in quality of their Governor-General,
and Lieutenant of the King, in the Provinces of Holland,
Zealand, West Friesland, and Utrecht, upon the same
footing as these offices had been conferred upon him by
his Majesty, there having been since no change or alteration
of anything, which was conformable to the laws and
customs of the country. Holland was the first, which in
1575, gave him a greater authority, but we do not find
anywhere that the States ever declared him Stadtholder in
their name; and Maurice, his son, ought to be considered
as the first Governor and Stadtholder of their creation.
His first instructions are extant; they were very confined;
but they gave him more authority in 1587, after the departure
of the Earl of Leicester. His successors in the Stadtholdership
have had no instructions, but only commissions,
and since that time their authority is very much augmented.</p>

<p>"The commission given the 12th of May, 1747, to his
Serene Highness, William the Fourth, father of the present
Stadtholder, by the States of Holland, who conferred
upon him, 'The power, the authority, and the command,
to exercise the office of Governor, Captain-General, and
Admiral; to protect, to advance, and to maintain the rights,
the privileges, and the well being of the Province and of
its members, cities and inhabitants, as well as the worship
of the true reformed Christian religion, such as it is taught
in the public churches, and to preserve and defend it
against all molestation, oppression, disorder, disunion, detriment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and damage. Moreover, to administer justice in the
said Province of Holland and West Friesland, to obtain
and duly to grant the provisions of justice to all those who
shall require it, and to put them in execution, the whole,
as far as regards the affairs of justice, by the advice of the
President and Counsellors of the Court of Holland and
West Friesland. To him, moreover, is given the power of
granting, after having taken the advice of the Court of Justice,
letters of grace, remission, pardon, and abolition, provided
the said letters be duly &mdash;&mdash; it being well
understood, nevertheless, that they shall not be granted for
murders, unpardonable in their nature, or for enormous
crimes committed, &mdash;&mdash; or by premeditated
design; and for what concerns the military and the police,
to act in this respect with the approbation of the States
and the advice of their Counsellors and Deputies, conformably
to their instructions; to change the Burgomasters
and the Sheriffs of the cities and places of the Province,
as may be convenient, conformably to the privileges
of each city and of each place; moreover, both by land and
sea, to watch over the safety and the good order of places
and fortresses of the Province where there shall be occasion.'</p>

<p>"The conditions upon which William the First was
elected Earl of Holland, are related in the seventh volume
of the history of the country, according to the resolutions
of the States of Holland of that time. The Prince had
agreed to them. All the cities of Holland, excepting Amsterdam
and Gonda, had consented to them; and the Provinces
of Zealand and Utrecht would without doubt have
followed this example. These conditions contained among
others,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
First, That if the Prince contravened in any points, and
did not redress the grievances at the requisitions of the
States, these should be free from all engagements to him,
and should have a right to provide of themselves for the
government. Secondly, That after the death of the
Prince, such of his sons as the States should judge the
most capable, should be made Earl on the same footing.
Thirdly, That the Prince should engage himself by oath
to the observation of these conditions stipulated, and that
the States on their part should do the same towards him.</p>

<p>"In the preamble of the acts, by which the States confer
the sovereign authority upon Prince William the First, is
found these remarkable words, which are there laid down
for a fundamental rule. 'That all Republics and communities
ought to preserve and maintain themselves, and fortify
themselves by unanimity, which cannot take place
among so many members often different in will and in sentiments;
it was by consequence necessary that the government
should be conferred upon one single chief.' From
the establishment of the Republic, the good politicians and
the greatest part of the inhabitants of these Provinces have
regarded the Stadtholderian government as an essential
part of the constitution. Accordingly, it has not been but
twice without a Stadtholder, that is to say, from the year
of 1650 to 1672, and again from the month of March,
1702, to April, 1747.</p>

<p>"The Stadtholdership has not been interrupted in Friesland,
nor in the Provinces of Groningen and Ommelanden;
but heretofore, the power of the Stadtholders of these two
Provinces whose ancient instructions are to be found in
Aitzema and elsewhere, although they have no place at
present, was confined in more narrow bounds, and until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
William the Fourth, there never was a Stadtholder of all
the seven Provinces together.</p>

<p>"The Stadtholdership, and the offices of Captain-General
and Admiral-General of each of the seven Provinces of
the country of Drenthe, and of the generality, are at present
hereditary, not only in the male line, but also in the
female. The Stadtholder cannot declare war, nor make
peace, but he has, in quality of Captain-General, the command
in chief of all the forces of the State, and the military
men are obliged to obey him in all that regards the
military service. He is not restrained by instructions, and
he disposes of the patents, an article very important in all
that concerns the military.</p>

<p>"In this Republic, they call patents the orders in
writing, which the Captain-General sends to the troops
to march. He orders the marches, provides for the garrisons,
and changes them at his pleasure. The ordinances
and military regulations proceed from him alone; it is he,
who constitutes and authorises the High Council of War of
the United Provinces, and who, as Captain-General of
each Province, disposes of all military offices as far as that
of Colonel, inclusively. The highest posts, as those of
Field Marshals, of Generals and Lieutenant-Generals, are
given by the States-General, who choose those to fill them
whom his Highness recommends. It is he also, who gives
the governments, commandants, &amp;c. of cities and places of
arms of the Republic, and those of the barrier. The persons
named, present their acts to their High Mightinesses,
who provide them with commissions. In disposing of
civil employments, which are in their departments, the
States-General have always a great deal of regard also
to the recommendations of his Highness. The power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
of the Stadtholder, as Grand Admiral, extends itself over
everything which regards the naval forces of the State,
and the other affairs of the departments of the Admiralties.
These councils, called the Admiralties, preside over the
perception [?] of the duties of entries, inwards and outwards,
and have the direction of the custom-house, as well
as that of the Admiralty. He presides here in person or by
his representatives; and as chief of all these councils in
general and of each one in particular, he is able to cause
to be observed and executed their instructions, both by
themselves, and what concerns them. He disposes of the
employs of Lieutenant-Admirals and others, who command
under him, and creates also the captains (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de haut
bord</i>). The Grand Admiral, who has his part in all the
prizes which are made, both by the vessels of the State
and by privateers, establishes, when it is necessary, maritime
councils of war, who do right in the name of their
High Mightinesses, and of his Highness, but whose sentences
are not executed until after he has approved and
confirmed them. It is the same in those of the High
Council of War of the United Provinces.</p>

<p>"Here follows the <small>COMMISSION</small> of the Prince, exactly
translated from the Dutch.</p>

<p>"The States-General of the United Provinces of the
Low Countries, to all those who shall see or hear these
presents, greeting. We make known, that it being necessary
to authorise and establish one person capable and
qualified as Captain-General and Admiral-General of the
people of war, by sea and land, who are in our service,
for the maintenance of the State and of the government of
this country, and for the direction of the affairs of war; for
these causes, considering the good qualities and the capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
of his Highness, the Prince William Charles Henry
Friso, by the Grace of God, Prince of Orange and of
Nassau, Earl of Catzeneltebogen, Vianden, Dietz, &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c. and relying upon his firmness, valor, and inclination,
for the prosperity of these countries, we have established
and authorised, and we do establish and authorise his
Most Serene Highness, the said Prince William Charles
Henry Friso, Captain and Admiral-General over the
people of war, who are in our service by sea and by land,
giving to his Highness full power and authority to command,
in that quality, all the said troops, and order them
all that is convenient for the conservation and the maintenance
of the union, for the safeguard and the defence of
the State, for the tranquillity, the rights and the privileges
of the country, both in general, and of each Province in
particular; and for the protection of the inhabitants, as
also for the conservation of the true reformed religion, in
the manner that it is at present exercised, and under the
public authority in the associated Provinces and cities; in
fine, for the maintenance of the present form of government;
the whole with the authority, the rights, the honors,
and pre-eminence, thereto annexed. We have, moreover,
conferred on his Serene Highness, as we hereby confer
upon him, by these presents, until we shall have made
known that we have disposed otherwise, the free power to
dispose of patents and other things which relate to war,
as the Lords, Princes of Orange, glorious ancestors of his
Serene Highness have done, in quality of Stadtholders
with relation to the troops. We command and ordain,
most expressly, to all and every one, particularly to the
officers of the troops, Colonels, Captains of Cavalry and of
Infantry, and of other people of war in our service and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
pay, to acknowledge, respect, and obey his Serene Highness
in that quality, giving him all succor, favor, and assistance,
in executing his orders. His Serene Highness, as
Captain-General of the State, shall take the ordinary oath
to us, or to those whom we shall depute for that end, upon
the instructions<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which we shall judge proper to prepare
in this respect. Done, in our Assembly at the Hague,
the 4th of May, 1747.</p>

<p>"The Sladtholder grants likewise, letters of grace, of
pardon, and abolition, both of the crimes which they call
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">communia delicta</i>, and of military offences. In Holland
and Zealand, these letters are made out for the former, in
the name of the States, with the advice of his Highness;
in cases of common crimes, he consults the courts of justice,
the counsellors deputies of the Provinces, the Council
of State, and the tribunals of justice of the cities respectively,
according to the nature of the case, and concerning
the others, the High Council of War, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"In the Provinces of Holland and Zealand, the Stadtholder
makes every year an election of the magistrates
of the cities, upon a representation or nomination of a
double number, which the cities themselves send to him.
He has the choice of two, and in some cases, of three candidates,
whom the States of Holland name to fill the
offices, which their Noble and Grand Mightinesses, and
formerly the Chamber of Accounts of their dominions had
the disposition or election of, when there was no Governor.
In some cities, the Stadtholder elects only the
sheriffs, in others the burgomasters and sheriffs, and in
some, the counsellors of the cities also. The magistrates,
in taking possession of their offices, promise by oath, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
maintain the rights, privileges, and immunities of their
cities and citizens; and they take an oath also of fidelity
to the States of Holland and Friesland. In 1672, the
magistrates of Dort, added 'as also to his Serene Highness,
the Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of the Province,' and
the same thing was done in 1747, but only in Dort.
When the States, in extraordinary cases which require it,
judge proper to invest him with an act of authority, he can
dismiss all these magistrates and replace them by others.
This was done upon this footing, in 1672 and 1748.
'Saving their honor, and without its being permitted to suspect
them of having ill conducted in the exercise of their
offices, the Stadtholder promising to take, in case of need,
their persons and their families under his protection and
safeguard, &amp;c.' The Prince of Maurice having changed
in 1718 the magistrates of the greatest part of the cities,
was thanked for it by the States of Holland, who, by their
resolution of the 16th of November of the same year, approved
unanimously of what his Excellency had done.</p>

<p>"There are some few offices, which, by the constitution,
the States have the disposal of, but in effect, the Stadtholder
disposes of all offices, and is by this means in a capacity
to oblige and attach to him, the magistrates of the
cities, and other persons whom he pleases to gratify with
them. He elects the counsellors and inspectors of the
dykes of Rhynland, of Delfland, and of Schieland, &amp;c.
upon a presentation of three persons which these Colleges,
established in Holland for many centuries, send directly to
him. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, in an old ordinance,
calls these officers Counsellors of the Dykes.
Their offices are for life; and besides these three Colleges,
there are still several others in Holland, but the
three abovementioned are the most considerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>"In virtue of the regulations made in 1674 and 1675,
and renewed since the accession of the Prince to the Stadtholdership,
he has a great power in the Provinces of
Guelderland, Utrecht, and Overyssel. The decision of the
differences, which may there arise among the respective
members and quarters belong to him; all the offices and
commissions, which are exercised both in the Provinces
and without. The States of Guelderland had, in 1748,
conferred on the Prince Stadtholder the power of correcting,
changing, and augmenting the regulation of the Regency
of the year 1675, as his Highness should judge
necessary for the good and advantage of the Province, in
case that in this regulation he should find articles, which,
according to the constitution of the present form of government,
have occasion to be altered. But his Highness, in
re-establishing it, did not judge proper to avail himself of
this concession, which he nevertheless accepted in 1750.
See the last article of the regulation published that year.
In 1748, the Quarter of Nimeguen made a present to the
Prince of the Earldom of Culembourg, and the States of
Overyssel did the same with regard to the lands, which
they possessed in the Earldom of Bantheim. By this he
is the First Member of the States, and Sovereign Lord of
the Lower Earldom.</p>

<p>"He has at his disposal all the offices and commissions
in the Provinces of Groningen and Ommelanden, since the
regulation of the year 1748, and the Prince Stadtholder
has also acquired the greatest prerogatives in Friesland, by
the regulation of December, 1748. As Stadtholder of
the country of Drenthe and of the territory of the Generality,
he has also very fair prerogatives, and annual appointments.
The Council of State of the United Provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
as well as the Councils Deputies of Holland and
West Friesland, have, of their own motion offered, and at
last conceded to his Highness all the employments which
were in their disposal. By the articles ninth, sixteenth,
and twentyfirst of the Treaty of Union of Utrecht, the
Stadtholders of that time had been named provisionally,
arbiters of the differences, which contrary sentiments and
opposite views might occasion among the confederates,
who, in thus submitting to an arbitration of points so important,
had considered no doubt, that in fact there could
not be any union or confederation among allies, who united
themselves so closely, without agreeing upon means of
coming to a conclusion, in cases, in which the plurality of
voices did not take place.</p>

<p>"Since the re-establishment of the Stadtholdership on
the footing where it is at present, similar differences between
the Provinces are no longer to be feared; the
Prince Stadtholder, being fortified with a power sufficiently
great to maintain the union, by preventing the
consequences of all which might disturb it, or being a prejudice
to the State in general, or to the Provinces, or their
Quarters, or their members in particular; finally to take
and put in execution the measures and resolutions necessary,
&amp;c. His Highness presides in the Court of Holland,
and in the Courts of Justice of the other Provinces, and
his name is placed at the head of their commandments,
ordinances, and bills. In Overyssel and in the Province
of Utrecht, the fiefs are held in the name of the Prince
Stadtholder. He is supreme curator of the Universities of
Guelderland, of Friesland, and Groningen, Grand Forrester
and Grand Hunter in Guelderland, Holland, and other
places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>"In the Province of Utrecht, his Highness, by virtue of
the regulation of the year 1674, disposes of the provostship,
and other benefices, which have remained attached to
the chapters, as also the canonical prebends, which have
fallen vacant in the months which were formerly called
Popish.</p>

<p>"Conformably to the first article of the instructions of
the Council of State of the United Provinces, the Stadtholder
is the first member of it, and has there the right of
suffrage, with an appointment of twentyfive thousand florins
a year. In virtue of a resolution of the States-General, of
the 27th of February, the Prince of Orange had enjoyed
it before his elevation to the Stadtholdership, having been
placed, from the year 1670, in the Council of State. The
26th of July, 1746, their High Mightinesses granted the
same appointments to the Prince Stadtholder.</p>

<p>"He assists also, whenever he judges proper for the
service of the State, at the deliberations of the States-General,
there to make propositions, &amp;c. and sometimes
also at the conferences held by the Deputies of their High
Mightinesses in the several departments, according to the
order established at the Assemblies of the States of particular
Provinces, and at those of their Counsellors, or
States Deputies. In Guelderland, in Holland, and in the
Province of Utrecht, his Highness participates of the
sovereignty, as Chief, or President of the body of Nobles;
and in Zealand, where he possesses the Marquisate of
Veere and of Flessingue as First Noble, and representing
alone all the nobility. In his absence, he has in
Zealand his representatives, who hold the first place, who
have the first voice in all the councils, and the first of
whom is always First Deputy from this Province at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Assembly of their High Mightinesses. The three quarters
of the Province of Guelderland conferred the dignity of
Chief, or President of the Body of Nobles, on his Serene
Highness, in 1750. None of his predecessors had it, but
Basnage says, in his Annals of the United Provinces, that
the Prince William the Second, a little before his death,
had a design to get himself elected First Noble in Guelderland,
where the nobility had been at all times devoted
to him.</p>

<p>"The Body of Nobles of Holland, having prayed in
1635, the Prince Frederick Henry to do them the honor
of being their Chief, his Highness, who as Stadtholder had
neither seat nor voice in the Assembly of the States of
the Province, graciously accepted of this offer, and became
thereby a permanent member of it. The Body of Nobles
have done the same with regard to the successors of this
Prince.</p>

<p>"Veere and Flessingue are two of the six cities, which,
with the First Noble compose the Assembly of the States
of Zealand. The councils in Zealand, in which the Prince
or his representatives have the first voice, are the Assembly
of the States, and of the Counsellors Deputies; in the
Council of the Admiralty, in the Chambers of Accounts,
and in the Assembly, that they name the States of Walcheren,
a College, which has the care of the dykes of this
part of the Province. It appears, that under the precedent
Stadtholders, the Assembly of the States of Zealand,
composed, as at present, of the First Noble, and the six
cities, disposed of all provincial offices and commissions,
and one may see, by the resolution of the States of Zealand
of the 15th of June, 1751, how this affair has been
regulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>"In 1749, the Prince Stadtholder was created by the
States-General, Governor-General and Supreme Director
of the Companies of the East and West Indies, dignities
which gave him a great deal of authority and power, and
which had not been conferred upon any of his predecessors.
They have not yet been rendered hereditary. He
has his representatives in the respective chambers, and
chooses the Directors of the two companies, upon a nomination
of three persons, who have the qualifications necessary
to be elected. From his elevation to the Stadtholdership,
the Prince enjoyed in Zealand this prerogative.
His Serene Highness enjoys, without paying taxes, as the
precedent Stadtholder might have enjoyed, the thirtieth
part of all the divisions, which the East India Company
makes; that is to say, the dividends of sixtysix actions
and two thirds, each action being reckoned at three thousand
florins, old capital. See the resolutions of their
High Mightinesses, of the twentyseventh of November,
1747, when the company gives to the interested a dividend
of fifty per cent, the portion of the Stadtholder amounts to
fifty thousand florins. The Prince Stadtholder represents
the dignity and the grandeur of the Republic, and without
bearing the name of sovereign, and doing all in the name
of the States, of which he is the Lieutenant-General, he enjoys
in several respects, even the effects of the sovereignty.
We have already seen what are his principal prerogatives,
his authority, his great credit, and his influence in all
affairs.</p>

<p>"The Ambassadors and other Ministers in foreign Courts
hold their commissions and receive their instructions from
the States-General, who nevertheless do not name to these
employs, excepting such as are agreeable to the Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Stadtholder, and recommended by his Highness. These
Ministers address their despatches to their High Mightinesses,
or to their Register, and correspond also with the
Counsellor Pensionary of Holland. They also render an
account to the Prince Stadtholder of the negotiations with
which they are charged, and of all important and secret
affairs.</p>

<p>"Treaties, alliances, conventions, &amp;c. are negotiated,
signed, and ratified in the name of the States-General,
after having been communicated to the Provinces and ratified
by them. The name of the Prince Stadtholder does
not appear, but he can, when there is a question concerning
his particular affairs, enter into negotiation with foreign
Courts, and conclude with them treaties, as it was done
with Spain in 1646 and 1647.</p>

<p>"Some of the foreign Ministers who reside at the Hague,
are also accredited with the Prince Stadtholder. The
prerogatives of the Prince Stadtholder of the Republic are
at present sufficiently fixed; but they are not precisely the
same in all the Provinces. The appointments and revenues
of the Stadtholder and Captain-General, to consider
them even in proportion, cannot be put in parallel with
those of a King of England. Nevertheless, it is reckoned
that the revenues of the Stadtholdership of the Seven
United Provinces, of the country of Drenthe and the Territory
of the Generality, comprehending the twentyfive
thousand florins which the Prince enjoys annually as First
Member of the Council of State, and the dividends of the
company of the East Indies, amount to three hundred thousand
florins a year. The Stadtholder pays neither imposts
nor taxes, excepting those which they call in Holland <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Odinarés
Verponding</i>, which is raised in this Province upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the lands and upon the houses, &amp;c. The body guards
and the aid-de-camp of his Most Serene Highness are entertained
at the expense of the union. Holland alone pays
the company of a hundred Swiss, and makes good the
hire of the houses, which the Prince Stadtholder and some
of the principal officers of his house occupy at the Hague,
who enjoy also a freedom from excises. On some occasions,
the Counsellors Deputies of Holland and West
Friesland, dispose, upon the proposition of the Stadtholder,
or of the Counsellor Pensionary in his behalf, of certain
sums necessary for the service of the State; and upon an
act of this Council, they pass them in account at the Receiver-General
of the Province.</p>

<p>"As Captain-General of the union, his Highness has a
hundred thousand florins of appointments a year, besides
twentyfour thousand from Friesland, and twelve thousand
from Groningen, in quality of Captain-General of these two
Provinces. In time of war, the State grants extraordinary
sums to the Captain-General, for the expense of each campaign.</p>

<p>"The Prince Stadtholder, as the eminent head of the
Republic, is revered, honored, and respected by all the
world. The Princes of Orange, by the great revenues of
their patrimonies, both of their principalities and of their
signorial lands in France, Germany, and Burgundy, and in
divers places of the United Provinces, have frequently
been a great support to the State. William the First, the
father of his country, who always preferred the prosperity
of the Republic to his own and that of his house,
raised twice, and led an army, in a great part at his own
expense, as we may see by the public declaration, which
the States-General made of it, in the inscription of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
mausoleum, which they raised to the memory of this great
man, in one of the churches of Delft.</p>

<p>"Offers the most tempting for them and for their houses
have been made to the Stadtholders, provided they would
depart ever so little from the engagements which they had
taken with their country; but they have rejected them all
with disdain, and would not have other friends nor other
enemies than those of the Republic. As she was in some
sort their daughter, they could not but have a lively affection
for her, to such a degree as to be at all times ready to
sacrifice their lives and all things to her defence. Thus
they have been the authors and conservators of her liberties,
in the first place against the Spanish tyranny, and
since against an enemy still more formidable, who opened
to himself in 1672 a passage into the heart of the Republic.
The same thing was near happening in 1748."</p>

<p>I have translated this from the French, because it is not
often to be found, and is the shortest and best account of
the Stadtholdership I can find. It is full of instruction to
the United States of America, and will serve to explain
many political phenomena. As all these powers are in
possession of a family connected by blood and by ancient
habits and political alliances to that of Hanover, we may
easily see, that the American cause will meet with powerful
obstacles. I am still, however, of opinion, that it would
be good policy to send a Minister Plenipotentiary here,
accredited both to the States-General and to the Prince
Stadtholder, without this even a loan of money will scarcely
succeed. Mr Laurens is taken and carried to England.</p>

<h3>TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, October 14th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The extracts of letters you were so good as to send me,
have been inserted in the papers, and I should be obliged
to you for future communications of the same kind. Notwithstanding
the flow of spirits, and the vigorous exertions
of our countrymen this year, I am sorry to say I cannot
see a prospect of anything decisive this campaign. The
fatal defect in the plan of the campaign in not sending a
sufficient number of ships with M. de Ternay, or soon after
him, will render abortive all the great exertions and immense
expenses of the year. And, at the same time,
Cornwallis will spread too much devastation at the southward,
where the want of numbers of whites, the great
numbers of blacks, and above all the want of discipline
and experience, will make the people long unhappy and
unfortunate.</p>

<p>The ill luck of Carolina, pursues her citizens even to
sea, and to Europe, I think. Can nothing be done for the
relief of Mr Laurens. Will you be so good as to apply to
Court, and see if they will send us somebody suitable to
exchange for him? After exchanging so many military
men as prisoners of war, it is pitiful to use Mr Laurens as
they do.</p>

<p>I have felt the mortification of soliciting for money as
well as you. But it has been because the solicitations
have not succeeded. I see no reason at all that we should
be ashamed of asking to borrow money, after maintaining
a war against Great Britain and her allies for about six
years, without borrowing anything abroad, when England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
has been all the time borrowing of all the nations of Europe,
even of individuals among our allies, it cannot be unnatural,
surprising, or culpable, or dishonorable for us to
borrow money. When England borrows, annually, a sum
equal to all her exports, we ought not to be laughed at for
wishing to borrow a sum, annually, equal to a twelfth part
of our annual exports. We may, and we shall wade
through, if we cannot obtain a loan; but we could certainly
go forward with more ease, convenience, and safety by the
help of one. I think we have not meanly solicited for
friendship anywhere. But to send Ministers to every great
Court in Europe, especially the maritime Courts, to propose
an acknowledgment of the independence of America,
and treaties of amity and commerce, is no more than becomes
us, and in my opinion is our duty to do. It is perfectly
consistent with the genuine system of American
policy, and a piece of respect due from new nations to old
ones. The United Provinces did the same thing, and
were never censured for it, but in the end they succeeded.
It is necessary for America to have agents in different parts
of Europe, to give some information concerning our affairs,
and to refute the falsehoods that the hired emissaries of
Great Britain circulate in every corner of Europe, by
which they keep up their own credit and ruin ours. I have
been more convinced of this, since my peregrinations in
this country than ever. The universal and profound ignorance
of America here, has astonished me. It will require
time and a great deal of prudence and delicacy to undeceive
them. The method you have obligingly begun of
transmitting me intelligence from America, will assist me in
doing, or at least attempting, something of this kind, and I
therefore request the continuance of it, and have the honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
to be, with respectful compliments to Mr Franklin and all
friends, Sir, your most obedient servant,</p>

<p class="signature">
JOHN ADAMS.

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, October 14th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Repeated letters from London confirm the account of
Mr Laurens being confined in the Tower; so close a prisoner,
that neither his old correspondents, nor even his
refugee relations, are suffered to speak to him.</p>

<p>There have been so many precedents of exchanges, Mr
Lovell, as well as the Major-Generals, Sullivan, Stirling,
Lee, and others, having been exchanged as prisoners of
war, that it is very extraordinary they should now treat Mr
Laurens as a prisoner of State. It is not, however,
merely a proof that passion and caprice govern their councils.
I conceive it is intended to signify to the tories in
America, whom they believe to be more numerous than
they are, and to their officers and troops serving in that
country, that now they have obtained an election of Parliament
to their minds, they are determined to prosecute
the war with vigor, and to bring America still to unlimited
submission. For, however, our countrymen may have
flattered themselves with hopes of peace, there is nothing
further from the thoughts of the King of England, his Ministers,
Parliament, or nation, (for they are now all <em>his</em>,)
than peace, upon any terms that America can agree to.
There is no future event more certain in my mind, than
that they never will acknowledge American independence
while they have a soldier in the United States. Nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
they would not do it, even after their troops should be
driven from the continent.</p>

<p>I think I see very clearly, that America must grow up
in war. It is a painful prospect, to be sure. But when I
consider, that there are more people in America than there
are in the United Provinces of the Low Countries, that the
earth itself produces abundance in America, both for consumption
and exportation, and that the United Provinces
produce nothing but butter and cheese, and that the United
Provinces have successfully maintained wars against
the formidable monarchies of Spain, France, and England,
I cannot but persuade myself, it is in the power of
America to defend herself against all that England can do.</p>

<p>The Republic, where I now am, has maintained an
army of a hundred and twenty thousand men, besides
a formidable navy. She maintains at this day a standing
army of thirty thousand men, which the Prince is
desirous of augmenting to fifty thousand, besides a considerable
navy; all this in a profound peace. What cause,
physical or political, can prevent three millions of people
in America from maintaining for the defence of their
altars and fireside, as many soldiers as the same number
of people can maintain in Europe, merely for parade, I
know not.</p>

<p>A navy is our natural and our only adequate defence.
But we have only one way to increase our shipping and
seamen, and that is privateering. This abundantly pays
its own expenses, and procures its own men. The seamen
taken, generally enlist on board of our privateers,
and this is the surest way of distressing their commerce,
protecting our own, increasing our seamen, and diminishing
those of the enemy. And this will finally be the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
by capturing their supplies, that we shall destroy, or captivate,
or oblige to fly, their armies in the United States.</p>

<p>A loan of money in Europe would assist privateering,
by enabling us to fit out ships the more easily, as well as
promote and extend our trade, and serve us in other ways.
I fear that Cornwallis' account of his defeat of General
Gates, whether true or false, will extinguish the very moderate
hopes which I had before, for a time.</p>

<p>There is a prospect, however, that the English will
force this Republic into a war with them, and in such case,
or indeed in any case, if there were a Minister here accredited
to the States-General and to the Prince Stadtholder
of the United Provinces of the Low Countries, he
would assist a loan. There is another measure which
may be taken by Congress to the same end; that is, sending
some cargoes of produce, upon account of the United
States directly here, or to St Eustatia, to be sold for the
payment of interest. The sight of a few such vessels and
cargoes would do more than many long reasonings and
negotiations.</p>

<p>Another method may be taken by Congress. Make a
contract with private merchants in Philadelphia, Boston,
Maryland, Virginia, or elsewhere, to export annually produce
to a certain amount, to Amsterdam or St Eustatia, or
both, to be sold for the payment of interest. The merchants,
or houses contracted with should be responsible,
and known in Europe, at least some of them.</p>

<p>This country has been grossly deceived. It has little
knowledge of the numbers, wealth, and resources of the
United States, and less faith in their finally supporting their
independence, upon which alone a credit depends. They
have also an opinion of the power of England, vastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
higher than the truth. Measures must be taken, but with
great caution and delicacy, to undeceive them.</p>

<p>I have this moment the honor of your letter of the 20th
of this month, and it is as cold water to a thirsty soul. I
have been busily employed in making inquiries, in forming
acquaintances, and in taking advice. In hopes of Mr
Laurens' arrival, and wishing him to judge for himself, I
have not decided upon some questions that necessarily
arise. I am not able to promise anything, but I am led to
hope for something. The contents of Mr Jay's letters
will certainly be of great weight and use. I am assured of
the good will of a number of very worthy and considerable
people, and that they will endeavor to assist a
loan.</p>

<p>Let me entreat your Excellency to communicate to me
everything you may further learn respecting the benevolent
intentions of the Court of Madrid, respecting this matter.
I will do myself the honor to acquaint you with the
progress I make. I was before in hopes of assisting you
somewhat, and your letter has raised these hopes a great
deal, for the English credit certainly staggers here a
little.</p>

<p>The treatment of Mr Laurens is truly affecting. It
will make a deep and lasting impression on the minds of
the Americans; but this will not be a present relief to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, October 24th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received several letters from London concerning
Mr Laurens. It is certain, that he has been treated with
great insolence by the populace, in his journey from Dartmouth
to London, and that he is confined to a mean
apartment in the Tower, denied the use of pen and ink,
and none of his friends has been able to obtain leave to
visit him, excepting his son and Mr Manning, and these
positively limited to half an hour. He is sick with a cholera,
much emaciated, and very much incensed against the
authors of his ill usage. I saw last night a letter from Mr
Manning himself, so that there is no doubt of the truth of
this account. This deliberate, this studied manifestation to
all the world, of their contempt and hatred of all America,
and of their final determination to pursue this war to the
last extremity, cannot be misunderstood. The honor, the
dignity, the essential interests, and the absolute safety of
America, requires that Congress should take some notice
of this event. I presume not to propose the measures that
might be taken, because Congress are in a much better
situation to judge.</p>

<p>I have waited in hopes of Mr Laurens' arrival, but now
all hopes of it are extinguished. I must fix upon a house,
and settle the conditions, in pursuance of my commission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
No time has been lost; it has all been industriously spent
in forming acquaintances, making inquiries, and taking advice
of such characters as it is proper to consult. The
present state of things affords no hopes, but from a particular
order of men. These I have endeavored to gain,
without giving offence to any others, and I am not without
hopes of obtaining something, though I much fear it will
be short of the expectations of Congress. I am not at
liberty yet to mention names, hereafter they will be known.
I cannot with too much earnestness recommend it to Congress,
to take measures if possible to send some cargoes
of produce to Amsterdam, or St Eustatia, for the purpose
of paying interest; a little of this would have a great
effect.</p>

<p>I ought not to conclude without repeating my opinion,
that a commission to some gentleman, of Minister Plenipotentiary,
is absolutely necessary.</p>

Amsterdam, October 27th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It seems to be now certain, that some of Mr Laurens'
papers were taken with him.</p>

<p>There have been sent to His Most Serene Highness,
the Prince of Orange, copies of letters from M. de Neufville,
Mr Gillon, Mr Stockton, and Colonel Derrick, and
a copy of the plan of a treaty projected between the city
of Amsterdam and Mr William Lee.</p>

<p>The Prince was much affected at the sight of these
papers, and laid them before their Noble and Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Mightinesses, the States of Holland and West Friesland.
One gentleman, at least, was present, who was concerned
in the transaction with Mr Lee, who handsomely avowed
the measure. The Regency of Amsterdam have since
given in writing a unanimous avowal of it, and of their determination
to support it. The letters of M. de Neufville
and Mr Gillon are said to be decent and well guarded.
So that upon the whole it seems to be rather a fortunate
event, that these papers have been publicly produced. I
wish I could say the same of Mr Laurens' captivity, but I
cannot. The rigor of his imprisonment, and the severity
of their behavior towards him, are not at all abated.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, October 31st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The British Ministry, by the terrible examples of the
rioters, have so intimidated the nation, and by their success
in the late elections have so great a majority in Parliament,
that they think themselves secure for seven
years, and seem determined to go on with more vigor than
ever.</p>

<p>The letters from their Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, &amp;c.
show, they are now adopting a new system. These letters
are full of panegyrics upon the tories and refugees.
Gage, and the two Howes, and Burgoyne, made light of
these auxiliaries, which made Mr Galloway their enemy,
who has been very industrious in exposing their characters.
Indeed the Ministry seem to be wholly governed now by
Mr Galloway, and their Generals seem to have adopted
the same sentiments. The consequence is, that in America,
at least where the British army rules, the refugees are
cherished. Cornwallis, in his last letter, in which he gives
an account of his battle with General Gates, assures the
Ministry, that he is determined to make some examples
among his prisoners. But none of these are more decisive
proofs of their present system, than their treatment of
Mr Laurens, whom they are holding up to that nation in
the frightful character of a rebel, knowing that this word,
and this idea, is enough to inflame them beyond all degrees
of reason.</p>

<p>It is not only in England and America, that they mean
to spread a terror; they think, that they can terrify all
nations, this in particular. They have sent over to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Most Serene Highness, the Prince of Orange, some copies
of letters taken with Mr Laurens. I cannot learn, that
there are any, but from M. de Neufville and Mr Gillon,
who are here. But it is propagated, that there are many
more, and M. Van Berckel and the Baron Van der Capellan
are named. But I have very good reason to believe,
that they have not a line of either.</p>

<p>The English are giving out, as is their practice every
fall, that they are determined to send great forces to America.
Fourteen regiments are talked of, ten thousand
men, but these threats will be executed as usual. Fourteen
regiments, if they send them, will not produce four
thousand men in America, to repair all their losses in
North America and the West Indies.</p>

<p>We have one enemy more pernicious to us than all their
army, and that is an opinion, which prevails in too many
American minds, that there is still some justice, some
honor, some humanity, and some reason in Great Britain,
and that they will open their eyes and make peace. That
there are individuals who have these virtues cannot be
doubted. Rome had many such, even after the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimi
Romanorum</i>. But they were so few, in comparison to
the whole, and had so little share in government, that they
only served, by their endeavors to bring things back, to
make the nation more miserable.</p>

<p>I am so fully convinced, that peace is a great way off,
and that we have more cruelty to encounter than ever, that
I ought to be explicit to Congress. We shall be forced to
wean ourselves from the little remainder of affection and
respect for that nation. Nay, even from our curiosity. I
cannot think it decent, that any American should voluntarily
set his foot on British ground, while we are treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
as we are. The practice is too common to step over,
upon motives of curiosity, pleasure, or business, and I cannot
but think it ought to be discountenanced.</p>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, November 4th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>M. de Neufville this morning brought me a number of
bills of exchange, drawn upon Mr Laurens, in the month
of July, amounting to seven or eight hundred pounds sterling,
and informed me that your Excellency had declined
becoming responsible for them and referred him to me. I
have inquired of Mr Searle, who informs me there are
about twenty thousand pounds in such bills now on their
way. If there were only seven or eight hundred pounds,
I would accept them, for the honor of the United States,
and run the venture of being able to pay them, by borrowing,
or some way or other; but twenty thousand pounds is
much beyond my private credit. I have been and am
pursuing all those measures, to which I am advised by gentlemen,
in whose judgment I can justify placing confidence,
and am not without hopes of succeeding in some
measure; but I have not as yet been able to obtain any
money, nor any certainty of obtaining any in future. I write
this, therefore, to your Excellency, that if you could see
your way clear to become responsible for these bills, for
the present, I will engage to see them paid with the money
I may borrow here, if I borrow enough before the term for
their payment expires, or as much of them as I shall be
able to borrow; but in this case, if I should not succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
in obtaining the money, your Excellency will be answerable.
I should be sorry that the credit of the United States
should suffer any stain, and would prevent it if I could;
but at present it is not in my power.</p>

<p>The successes of the English at the southward, added
to the many causes that obstructed our credit in this Republic
before, some of which it would not be prudent to
explain, will render a loan here difficult; but I still hope
not quite impracticable.</p>

Amsterdam, November 16th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 10th of this month, Sir Joseph Yorke presented
to the States-General the following</p>


<h3>MEMORIAL.</h3>

<p class="open">
"High and Mighty Lords,
</p>

<p>"The King, my master, has discovered during the whole
course of his reign the most sincere desire to maintain the
union, which has subsisted for more than a century between
his Crown and this Republic. This union rests upon the
immovable basis of reciprocal interest; and as it has contributed
much to the prosperity of the two nations, the
natural enemy of both employs all the resources of his
policy to destroy it. For sometime past, this enemy has
not labored but with too much success, being supported by
a faction, which seeks to govern the Republic, and which
is always ready to sacrifice the general interest to private
views. The King has seen with as much surprise as regret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the little effect which has been produced by his repeated
demands of the succors stipulated by the treaties,
and the representations of his Ambassadors, concerning the
daily violations of engagements the most solemn.</p>

<p>"The moderation of the King has induced him to attribute
this conduct of your High Mightinesses, to the intrigues
of an <em>overbearing cabal</em>; and his Majesty would
still persuade himself, that your justice and your intelligence
will determine you to fulfil your engagements towards
him, and to prove by all your proceedings your
resolution to put in vigor the system formed by the wisdom
of your ancestors, and the only one which can ensure the
safety and glory of the Republic. The answer of your
High Mightinesses to this declaration, which the subscriber
makes by the express order of his Court, will be the touchstone
of your sentiments and intentions towards the King.</p>

<p>"His Majesty has had for sometime indications without
number of the dangerous designs of an <em>unbridled cabal</em>.
But the papers of Mr Laurens, who calls himself a President
of a pretended Congress, have made a discovery of a
conspiracy without example in the annals of the Republic.
It appears by these papers, that the gentlemen of Amsterdam
have commenced a clandestine correspondence with
the rebels of America, from the month of August, 1778,
and that there were instructions and full powers given by
them, relative to the conclusion of an indissoluble treaty of
amity with these rebels, subjects of a sovereign, to whom
the Republic is bound by engagements the most strict.
The authors of this conspiracy pretend not to deny it; on
the contrary, they avow it, and endeavor in vain to justify
it. It is in these circumstances, that his Majesty, depending
on the equity of your High Mightinesses, demands a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
formal disavowal of a conduct so irregular, not less contrary
to your engagements the most sacred, than to the
fundamental laws of the Batavian Constitution. The King
demands also, a prompt satisfaction proportioned to the
offence, and an exemplary punishment of the Pensionary,
Van Berckel, and of his accomplices, as disturbers of the
public peace, and violators of the law of nations.</p>

<p>"His Majesty persuades himself, that the answer of your
High Mightinesses will be prompt and satisfactory in all
respects. But if the contrary should happen, if your
High Mightinesses refuse a demand so just, or endeavor to
evade it by silence, which will be considered as a refusal,
in that case, the King will not be able to consider the Republic
itself but as approving of misdemeanors, which it
refuses to disavow and to punish; and after such a conduct,
his Majesty will see himself in the necessity of taking
such measures, as the maintenance of his dignity and the
essential interests of his people demand.</p>

</p>

<p>Whether Sir Joseph Yorke, after twenty years' residence
in this Republic, is ignorant of its Constitution, or whether,
knowing it, he treats it in this manner, on purpose the more
palpably to insult it, I know not. The sovereignty resides
in the States-General; but who are the States-General?
Not their High Mightinesses, who assemble at the Hague
to deliberate; these are only deputies of the States-General.
The States-General are the Regencies of the cities,
and the bodies of nobles in the several Provinces. The
Burgomasters of Amsterdam, therefore, who are called the
Regency, are one integral branch of the sovereignty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Seven United Provinces, and the most material branch of
all, because the city of Amsterdam is one quarter of the
whole Republic, at least in taxes.</p>

<p>What would be said in England if the Count de Welderen,
Ambassador at the Court of London, had presented a
Memorial to the King, in which he had charged any integral
part of their sovereignty, as the whole House of
Lords, or the whole House of Commons, with conspiracies,
factions, cabals, sacrificing general interests to private
views, and demanded exemplary punishment upon them?
The cases are in nature precisely parallel, although there
are only three branches of the sovereignty in England,
and there are a greater number than three in Holland.</p>

<p>There are strong symptoms of resentment of this outrageous
Memorial in Amsterdam; but whether the whole
will not evaporate, I know not. Many persons, however,
are of opinion that a war is inevitable, and ensurance cannot
be had even to St Eustatia, since this Memorial was
made public, under twenty or twentyfive per cent.</p>

<p>This Memorial is so like the language of Lord Hillsborough
and Governor Bernard, that I could scarcely forbear
substituting Boston for Amsterdam, and Otis, or Hancock,
or Adams, for Van Berckel, as I read it. I should
not wonder if the next Memorial should charge the Republic
with rebellion, and except two or three from pardon.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, November 17th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>From the time of the arrival of my commission, I have
been constantly employed in forming acquaintances, making
inquiries, and asking advice; but am sorry to be obliged
to say, that hitherto I see no certain prospect of borrowing
any money at all.</p>

<p>For some years past, all the information I could obtain
from this country, led me to think that America had many
friends in this Republic, and that a considerable sum might
be borrowed here, provided application was made to Dutch
houses, of old families and numerous connexions. And
after my arrival here, I had the opinion of persons whom I
had every reason to think knew best, that if proper powers
should arrive from the thirteen United States, money might
be had. But now that all agree, that full powers have arrived,
I do not find the same encouragement. This nation
has been so long in the habit of admiring the English, and
disliking the French, so familiarized to call England the
natural ally, and France the natural enemy of the Republic,
that it must be the work of time to eradicate these prejudices,
although the circumstances are greatly altered.
Add to this the little decision and success which has appeared
in the conduct of the affairs of America and her
allies, and the series of small successes which the English
have had for the last twelve months; the suspense and uncertainty
in which men's minds have been held respecting
the accession of the Dutch to the armed neutrality; and at
last the publication of some papers taken with Mr Laurens,
the part the Stadtholder has acted, and the angry Memorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
of Sir Joseph Yorke concerning them; all these things
together have thrown this nation into a state of astonishment,
confusion, and uncertainty, to such a degree, that no
house that I have as yet thought it prudent to apply to,
dares to undertake the trust. The times are now critical
indeed. The question will be decided in a few days,
whether the Republic shall join the armed neutrality or
not. Four Provinces have voted for it; two others have
voted in such a manner that their deputies may agree to
it; and most men say it will be decided by the plurality.</p>

<p>The King of England demands a disavowal of the Amsterdam
Treaty, and the punishment of the Regency.
They will not be punished, nor their conduct disavowed.
The King of England, therefore, must take such measures
as he shall think his dignity, and the essential interests of
his people require. What these will be, time alone can
discover. Many think he will declare war, but more are
of a different opinion.</p>

<p>Congress, who have been long used to contemplate the
characters and the policy of this King and his Ministers,
will see that they are now pursuing towards this Republic,
the same maxims which have always governed them.
Their measures in America, for many years, were calculated
to divide the many from the few in the towns of Boston,
New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston; next, to
divide the Provinces from their capitals, and then to divide
the rest of the Continent from those Provinces, which took
the earliest a decided part.</p>

<p>Their plan now is, to divide the people of Amsterdam
from their Burgomasters, and to single out M. Van Berckel,
for the fate of Barnevelt, Grotius, or De Witt; to divide
the other cities of Holland from Amsterdam, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Provinces of the Republic from Holland. But they will
succeed no better in Holland than in America, and their
conduct bids fair to make M. Van Berckel the most respected
and esteemed of all the citizens.</p>

<p>In the present critical state of things, a commission of a
Minister Plenipotentiary would be useful here. It would
not be acknowledged, perhaps not produced, except in
case of war. But if peace should continue, it would secure
its possessor the external respect of all. It would give him
the right to claim and demand the prerogatives and privileges
of a Minister Plenipotentiary, in case anything should
turn up which might require it. It would make him considered
as the center of American affairs, and it would
assist, if anything would, a loan.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude without observing, that I cannot think
it would be safe for Congress to draw for money here,
until they shall receive certain information that their bills
can be honored. There are bills arrived, which if Mr
Franklin cannot answer, must, for what I know be protested.</p>

endeavors to borrow it here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>I have hitherto no prospect at all. When I first arrived
here, I had such informations as made me believe that a
sum of money might be had upon the credit of the United
States. But the news from Carolina, and New York and
the West Indies, but above all, the affair of the Burgomasters
and Sir Joseph Yorke's Memorial, have struck a panic
which must have time to wear off. At present I meet
with only one gentleman who thinks anything can be

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, November 26th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It is now certain that the States-General have, by a plurality
of five Provinces, determined to accede to the armed
neutrality. Zealand and Guelderland have agreed to it
likewise; but upon condition of a warranty of the possessions
of the Republic. If the intention of Sir J. Yorke's
memorial was to intimidate their High Mightinesses from
this measure, he has missed his aim. Nor will the conduct
of the Burgomasters of Amsterdam be disavowed,
nor M. Van Berckel, nor his accomplices, punished. We
shall see how the British Ministry will disentangle themselves
from this perplexity.</p>

<p>All these things, however, so far from aiding our affairs
in this nation, seem to have put an entire stop to them for
the present. The nation is trembling for their commerce,
their money in the British funds, their East and West India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
possessions, and no man dares engage in a measure that
may in some degree increase the alarm.</p>

<p>The bills upon Mr Laurens I have accepted, those of
them at least that have arrived, upon an assurance from
Dr Franklin, that in case I should not be able to borrow
the money by the time they become payable, that I may
draw upon him for it. I think Congress will perceive the
danger of drawing any more, until they shall receive intelligence
from me that the money is ready.</p>

<p>The choice of a house is a point of so much importance,
that I could not justify making it, without the most
mature inquiry and reflection. Not only the success of
the negotiation will depend upon it, but the political consequences
of it will be important. I have made every
inquiry and several proposals, but all have been politely
declined. There are two houses which I believe would
accept it, but these, although respectable, are so far from
the first rank that I should be sorry to fix upon either, if I
could see a prospect of gaining one of higher rank. I am
told, that opening the loan now would injure us exceedingly;
but I know not what to judge. I have found so
many opinions mistaken, that in this country I cannot judge
which are well founded.</p>

<p>Fear is ever the second passion in minds governed by
avarice. As long, therefore, as the English misrepresentations
can make people here believe that there is a possibility
of conquering America, or of our returning to the
government of England, so long we shall find little credit
here.</p>

<p>The Prince was ill advised when he undertook what he
was not obliged to do, in producing Mr Laurens' papers,
which he did too, in a manner justly offensive to the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
States. It was the part of Sir Joseph Yorke to have produced
them, not to the Prince, but to their High Mightinesses.
His Serene Highness, therefore, in this work of
supererogation, gave himself the air of an instrument of Sir
Joseph, which has not at all recommended him to the
Dutch nation.</p>

<p>But Sir Joseph, or his master, has committed a greater
mistake in presenting that intemperate memorial. It is
said, that he pleads positive orders; but many believe that
if he had such orders, he procured them from his Court,
and that the memorial was prepared at the Hague, and
adjusted to the state of parties and politics in the Republic.
Be this as it may, both the Prince and the Ambassador
have missed their aim, and the publication of Mr Laurens'
papers has had a contrary effect from what they expected
and intended.</p>

<p>The Republic, however, is in an embarrassed situation.
The Prince has a decided inclination for England. He
has the command of armies and navies, and the gift of
so many offices, that his influence is astonishing among the
nobility, and all the higher families. Besides this, the
clergy are very generally devoted to him, and their influence
among the populace is very great; so that there is
great danger that the Republic will not be able to exert its
real strength, even in case England should continue their
hostilities. I say continue, because it is certain that by
repeated violations of territory, as well as by innumerable
captures of innocent vessels, hostilities have been long since
begun.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of many here, that without the discovery
of Mr Laurens' papers, the Republic would not have
acceded to the armed neutrality. As this great confederation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
is now determined on, we shall see what will be its
effects. The Empress of Russia is not of a character to
be trifled with; yet I think the English will not respect the
new arrangement. They will violate the principles of it,
at least towards the Dutch, and risk a war with all the
maritime powers of the world at once, rather than relinquish
America, and agree to the principle of free ships,
free goods.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, November 30th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The state of parties in this Republic is still critical.
Many anonymous pamphlets appear on both sides. Those
which proceed from the English party, are virulent against
M. Van Berckel. The Republic itself wavers, according
to events and causes, which are impenetrable. A few days
ago, the plan appeared to be, to accede to the armed neutrality,
in order to satisfy one party, and to disavow the
conduct of Amsterdam, in forming with Mr Lee, the
project of a treaty, in order to appease the other.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Fifteen
cities, even in the Province of Holland, have disavowed
this measure; Haerlem and Dort are the only two, which
have approved it. The Grand Pensionary of Holland
has sent after the courier, who had been despatched to the
Plenipotentiaries at Petersburg, and brought him back to
the Hague. What alteration is to be made, is unknown.
It is now given out, that they have determined to increase
the fortifications of the maritime towns, and augment their
garrisons.</p>

<p>I see every day more and more of the inveterate prejudices
of this nation in favor of the English, and against the
French; more and more of the irresistible influence of
the Stadtholder, and more and more of the irresolution,
uncertainly, and confusion of the nation. How the whole
will conclude, I know not. One thing, however, is certain,
that Congress can depend upon no money from
hence. I have, confiding in the assurances of Dr Franklin,
accepted all the bills drawn upon Mr Laurens, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
have yet been presented to me, amounting to thirtyfour
thousand three hundred and fiftyeight guilders; but I have
no prospect of discharging them, or even of deriving my
own subsistence from any other source than Passy. Congress,
will, therefore, I presume, desist from any further
drafts upon Holland, at least until they receive certain information
that money has been borrowed, of which I see
no present prospect.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, December 14th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I am every day accepting the bills of exchange, which
were drawn upon Mr Laurens; but I have no prospect of
obtaining money to discharge them, from any other person
than Dr Franklin.</p>

<p>For some years before I came to Holland, every person
I saw from this place assured me, that in his opinion,
money might be borrowed, provided application was made
with proper powers directly from Congress to solid Dutch
houses. After my arrival here, these assurances were repeated
to me, by persons whose names I could mention,
and who I thought could not be deceived themselves, nor
deceive me. But now that powers have arrived, and application
has been made to Dutch houses undoubtedly
solid, these houses will not accept the business. In short,
I cannot refrain from saying, that almost all the professions
of friendship to America, which have been made, turn
out, upon trial, to have been nothing more than little adulations
to procure a share in our trade. Truth demands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of me this observation. Americans find here the politeness
of the table, and a readiness to enter into their trade,
but the public finds no disposition to afford any assistance,
political or pecuniary. They impute this to a change in
sentiments, to the loss of Charleston, the defeat of General
Gates, to Arnold's desertion, to the inactivity of the
French and Spaniards, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But I know better.
It is not the love of the English, although there is a great
deal more of that than is deserved, but it is fear of the
English and the Stadtholderian party.</p>

<p>I must, therefore, entreat Congress to make no more
drafts upon Holland, until they hear from me that their
bills can be accepted, of which, at present, I have no
hopes.</p>

<p>People of the first character have been, and are still
constantly advising, that Congress should send a Minister
Plenipotentiary here, and insist upon it that this would
promote a loan. It is possible it may; but I can see no
certainly that it will. Sending a few cargoes of produce,
would do something.</p>

<p>The Dutch are now felicitating themselves upon the
depth and the felicity of their politics. They have joined
the neutrality, and have disavowed Amsterdam, and this has
appeased the wrath of the English, the appearance of
which, in Sir Joseph Yorke's Memorial, terrified them
more than I ever saw any part of America intimidated in
the worst crisis of her affairs. The late news we have of
advantages gained by our arms in several skirmishes in
Carolina, contributes a little to allay the panic. But all in
Europe depends upon our success.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>War is to a Dutchman the greatest of evils. Sir Joseph
Yorke is so sensible of this, that he keeps alive a
continual fear of it, by memorials after memorials, each
more affronting to any sovereignty of delicate notions of
dignity than the former. By this means he keeps up
the panic, and while this panic continues, I shall certainly
have no success at all. No man dares engage for me;
very few dare see me.</p>

<p>On Tuesday last, the 12th of December, the British
Ambassador had a conference with the President of the
States-General, and upon that occasion presented to their
High Mightinesses the following Memorial.</p>

<p class="open">
"High and Mighty Lords,
</p>

<p>"The uniform conduct of the King towards the Republic,
the friendship which has so long subsisted between the
two nations, the right of sovereigns, and the faith of engagements
the most solemn, will, without doubt, determine
the answer of your High Mightinesses to the Memorial,
which the subscriber presented some time ago, by the express
order of his Court. It would be to mistake the wisdom
and the justice of your High Mightinesses to suppose,
that you could balance one moment to give the satisfaction
demanded by his Majesty. As the resolutions of your
High Mightinesses, of the 27th of November, were the
result of a deliberation, which regarded only the interior of
your government, and it was not then in question to answer
the said Memorial, the only remark which we shall make
upon those resolutions is, that the principles which dictated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
them, prove evidently the justice of the demand made by
the King. In deliberating upon this Memorial, to which
the subscriber hereby requires, in the name of his Court,
an answer immediate and satisfactory in all respects, your
High Mightinesses will recollect, without doubt, that the
affair is of the last importance; that the question is concerning
a complaint made by an offended sovereign; that
the offence, of which he demands an exemplary punishment
and complete satisfaction, is a violation of the Batavian
constitution, whereof the King is the warranty, an infraction
of the public faith, an outrage against the dignity
of his Crown. The King has never imagined that your
High Mightinesses would have approved of a treaty with
his rebel subjects. This would have been on your part a
commencement of hostilities, and a declaration of war.
But the offence has been committed by the magistrates of
a city, which makes a considerable part of the State, and
it is the duty of the sovereign power to punish and repair
it. His Majesty, by the complaints made by his Ambassador,
has put the punishment and the reparation into the
hands of your High Mightinesses, and it will not be but in
the last extremity, that is to say, in the case of a denial of
justice on your part, or of silence, which must be interpreted
as a refusal, that the King will take this charge upon
himself.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, December 21st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The sentiments and affections of a people may be
learned from many little circumstances, which few people
attend to. The poets and orators are generally considered
as the surest repositories of popular ideas, both in ancient
and modern nations. The clergy may be classed among
the latter, and it is very certain, that most public preachers
accommodate both their sermons and their prayers, in
some degree, to the general taste of their hearers, and
avoid everything which will unnecessarily give them
offence.</p>

<p>At Rotterdam, there are several English churches.
The Presbyterian church, which would be the least likely,
one should think, to be bigotted by England, I attended.
The parson in his prayer, after petitioning heaven for the
States of Holland and West Friesland, the States-General
and Council of State, and for the Prince of Orange, their
hereditary Stadtholder, and Governor, &amp;c. added a petition
for England, for the King, Queen, and royal family,
for their health, long life, and prosperity, and added, that
he might triumph over all his enemies in the four quarters
of the world.</p>

<p>At Amsterdam, I have attended both the Episcopal and
Presbyterian churches, and heard similar supplications to
heaven in both. At Utrecht, I attended the Presbyterian
church, and there heard a prayer for the English, with
much more fervor and in greater detail. The parson was
quite transported with his zeal, and prayed that the rebellion,
which has so long prevailed, might be suppressed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
hide its head in shame. At Leyden there is another English
church. The parson, I am told, is a tory, but prudently
omits such kind of prayers.</p>

<p>This is quite a work of supererogation in the reverend
zealots, and is, therefore, a stronger proof that such sentiments
are popular. The English, who are very numerous
in all these cities, are universally in favor of the British
Ministry. But there are so many Dutch families who
worship in these churches, that the parsons would not give
them offence, if such prayers were offensive. This is the
more remarkable, as the religion of North America is
much more like that of this Republic, than like that of
England. But such prayers recommend the parson to the
Prince of Orange, and to the English party, and no other
party or person has influence or courage enough to take
offence at them.</p>

<h3>
TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>
<p class="head">
Amsterdam, December 25th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It is very difficult to discover with certainty the secret
spring, which actuates the Courts of Europe; but whatever
I can find, with any degree of probability, I shall transmit
to Congress at one time or another.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange is himself of the royal family of
England; his mother was a daughter of King George the
Second, and this relation is no doubt one among the several
motives, which attach the Stadtholder to England. His
Princess is a niece of the King of Prussia, and it is believed
is not perfectly agreed with His Most Serene Highness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
in his enthusiasm for the English Court. The King
of Prussia has a great esteem and affection for his niece,
with whom he frequently corresponds. In some of his
letters he is supposed to have expressed his sentiments
freely upon the Prince's conduct, intimating, that his Highness
would take too much upon himself, and make himself
too responsible, if he persevered in a resolute opposition to
the armed neutrality. The Empress of Russia, who possesses
a masterly understanding, and a decided inclination
for America, is thought too, to have expressed some uneasiness
at the Prince's political system. The King of
Sweden, who was lately at the Hague, is reported to have
had free conversation with the Prince upon the same subject.
All these intimations together, are believed to have
made His Most Serene Highness hesitate a little, and consider
whether he was not acting too dangerous a part, in
exerting all his influence in the Republic, to induce it to
take a part in opposition to the general sense and inclination
of the people, and to all the maritime powers of
Europe.</p>

<p>The English Court is undoubtedly informed of all this.
They dread the accession of the Dutch to the armed neutrality,
more than all the other branches of that confederation,
because of the rivalry in commerce, and because
the Dutch will assist the Royal Marines of France and
Spain, more than all the others. The present conduct of
the English indicates a design to go to war with the Dutch,
on pretence of an insult to their Crown, committed two
years ago, by a treaty with America, in hopes, that they
will not be supported in this quarrel by the confederated
neutral powers. But they will be mistaken. The artifice
is too gross. The confederated powers will easily see, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the real cause of offence is the accession to the armed
neutrality, and the conduct of Amsterdam, in projecting a
treaty with America, only a pretence.</p>

<h3>
TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>
<p class="head">
Amsterdam, December 25th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The dispute between Great Britain and the United
Provinces is now wrought up to a crisis. Things must
take a new turn in the course of a few days, but whether
they will end in a war, or in the retraction of one party or
the other, time alone can determine.</p>

<p>I have before transmitted to Congress the two Memorials
of Sir Joseph Yorke, against M. Van Berckel, and
the Burgomasters of Amsterdam. The language of both
is conformable to that domineering spirit, which has actuated
the Councils of St James, from the beginning of this
reign, and they have committed the honor and dignity
of the King, and engaged the pride of the nation so far,
that there is no room left for a retreat, without the most
humiliating mortification. On the other hand, there is
authentic information, that the States proceeding in their
usual forms, have determined to refer the conduct of Amsterdam
to a committee of lawyers, who are to consider
and report, whether the Burgomasters have done anything,
which they had not by law and the Constitution authority
to do. It is universally known and agreed, that the report
must and will be in favor of the Burgomasters. This report
will be accepted and confirmed by the States, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
transmitted to all the neutral Courts, in order to show
them, that neither the Republic in general nor the city of
Amsterdam in particular, have done anything against the
spirit of the armed neutrality. The States have also determined
to make an answer to the British Ambassador's
Memorials, and to demand satisfaction of the King his
master, for the indignity offered to their sovereignty, in
those memorials. In this resolution, the States have been
perfectly unanimous, the Body of Nobles, for the first time,
having agreed with the Generality. The question then is,
which power will recede. I am confidently assured, that
the States will not; and indeed if they should, they may
as well submit to the King, and surrender their independence
at once. I am not, however, very clear what they
will do. I doubt whether they have firmness to look a war
in the face. Will the English recede, if the Dutch do
not? If they should, it would be contrary to the maxims,
which have invariably governed them during this reign. It
will humble the insolent overbearing pride of the nation;
it will expose the Ministry to the scoffs and scorn of opposition;
it will elevate the courage of the Dutch, the
neutral powers, and the House of Bourbon, not to mention
the great effect it will have in America, upon the whigs
and tories, objects which the British Court never loses
sight of.</p>

<p>This Republic is certainly, and has been for several
weeks, in a very violent struggle. It has every symptom
of an agony, that usually precedes a great revolution. The
streets of the city swarm with libels of party against party.
Some masterly pamphlets have been written in favor of the
Burgomasters. Thousands of extravagant and incredible
reports are made and propagated. Many new songs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
appear among the populace, one particularly adapted for
the amusement of the sailors, and calculated to inspire them
with proper sentiments of resentment against the English. A
woman, who sung it in the streets, the day before yesterday,
sold six hundred of them in an hour, and in one spot.
These are symptoms of war. But it is not easy to conquer
the national prejudices of a hundred years' standing,
nor to avoid the influence of the Stadtholder, which is
much more formidable. In this fermentation, the people
can think of nothing else, and I need not add, that I have
no chance of getting a ducat of money, but I think Congress
will see the necessity of having here in these critical
times more ample powers.</p>

Amsterdam, December 25th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Affairs are still in suspense. This day being Christmas,
and yesterday a Sunday, there was no public Exchange
held on either. But business, and especially stockjobbing,
goes on without ceasing, being done at the coffee-houses
on Sundays, and holy-days, when it cannot be held
upon 'Change.</p>

<p>The English mail, which had been interrupted by contrary
winds for three posts, arrived on Saturday. The
English gazettes of the 19th announced, that Sir Joseph
Yorke was recalled, and a Dutch war was inevitable.
Private letters informed, that the Count de Welderen was
about leaving the British Court, and that an embargo was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
laid on all Dutch ships in Great Britain; that the stocks
had fallen two per cent, and that a war was inevitable.
The stock-jobbers, Englishmen, and others at the coffee-houses,
had melancholy countenances, and uncommon
anxiety. News was also propagated from the Hague, that
Sir Joseph Yorke was gone. Others said he had received
his orders to go. As there was no Exchange, the public
judgment is not made up, whether there will be war or not.
Some gentlemen of knowledge and experience think all
this a farce, concerted at the Hague, between Sir Joseph
and his friends there, and the Ministry in England, in
order to spread an alarm, intimidate the States into an
answer, which may be accepted with a color of honor, &amp;c.
or to do something worse, that is, rouse a spirit among the
mobility against the Burgomasters of Amsterdam. I cannot,
however, but be of opinion, that there is more in this,
and that the Ministry will carry their rage to great extremities.
They have gone too far to look back, without
emboldening their enemies, confounding their friends, and
exposing themselves to the contempt and ridicule of both.
A few hours, however, will throw more light upon this important
subject. The plot must unravel immediately.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The public papers of this morning inform me, that Sir
Joseph Yorke left the Hague on the morning of the 24th,
without taking leave of anybody, and bent his way to London
by the way of Antwerp and Ostend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>Sometime in the month of April last, a certain British
Ambassador, who had an inclination to take a few of the
pleasures of Paris in his way to Germany, said in that city,
where I received the information in the time of it, "to be
sure the Americans will carry their point, and establish
their independence, for there will infallibly be a war between
England and Holland before Christmas."</p>

<p>If the war is considered to commence from the departure
of the Ambassador, Sir Joseph went off exactly in
time to accomplish the prophecy. Since the departure of
Sir Joseph has been generally known, the city has been in
a fermentation. The English Ministry are cursed here as
heartily as anywhere in general. Things are said by our
friends to be in a very good situation, but I never know
what to believe. The English are very bold I think; they
are very enthusiastic, they are sure of the assistance of
Providence, as sure of success against all their enemies as
the old lady was of relief from want, and making her fortune
by drawing a prize in the lottery. "But have you
bought a ticket, mamma?" said her daughter. "No, my
child," replied the old lady, "I have no ticket, but Providence
is Almighty, and therefore I am sure of the highest
prize, ticket or no ticket."</p>

<p>The Dutch say, that the English are acting the part of
the sailor, who having quarrelled with three others, as stout
as himself, and got his bones broken and eyes beat out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
the squabble, challenged four more to fight him at the
same time, that he might have it in his power to make up
with all seven <em>with honor</em>.</p>

<p>If the English are not actuated by the same blind and
vindictive passions, which have governed them so many
years, it is impossible to see through their policy. I think
it is impossible they should be ignorant of the articles of
confederation of the neutral powers. These articles as I
am informed, warrant to all the neutral powers their treaties
with England, and stipulate that if either is attacked
after the 20th of November last, it shall be made a common

<p>If the English should issue letters of marque against the
Dutch, the States-General will not immediately issue letters
of marque in return, but will represent the facts to
the Congress at Petersburg, and demand the benefit of the
treaty of armed neutrality, and all the powers who are
parties to that confederation will join in demanding of
England restitution, and in case of refusal, will jointly issue
letters of marque and reprisal.</p>

<p>The political machine that is now in motion, is so vast,
and comprehends so many nations, whose interests are not
easy to adjust, that it is perhaps impossible for the human
understanding to foresee what events may occur to disturb
it. But at present there is no unfavorable appearance
from any quarter. We are in hourly expectation of interesting
news from the English, French, and Spanish fleets,
from Petersburg, from London and the Hague, and especially
from North America. Every wheel and spring in
the whole political system of Europe would have its motions
rapidly accelerated by certain news from America, of
any decisive advantage obtained over Cornwallis, in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Carolina; so true it is, that America is the very centre and
axis of the whole.</p>

will make no alteration in the system of Europe. Yet it is
possible after some time there may be changes, none, however,
which can be hurtful to us.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, December 30th, 1780</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The Province of Zealand having been opposed to the
other Provinces in so many instances, and having lately
protested against the resolution of the States-General,
which begin to be thought spirited, it may be useful to explain
to Congress the causes which influence that Province
to a conduct which is generally thought to be opposite to
the true interest of the Republic in general.</p>

<p>In the States of Zealand there are only five voices,
three of which are absolutely in the discretion of the Prince
of Orange, who has one voice as Stadtholder of the Province,
another as Marquis of Veere, and a third as First
Noble. The Stadtholder is therefore absolute in this Province,
which accounts at once for its conduct upon every
occasion. The friends, however, of the Prince, of England,
and of Zealand, are not willing that the world should
believe that the Prince's power in this Province, and his
attachment to England are the sole causes of its conduct
upon every occasion, and therefore they enlarge upon several
topics, as apologies and excuses for a behavior, which
cannot wholly be justified. The arguments in justification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
or excuse of Zealand are drawn from four principal sources.
First, the situation of the islands, which compose the Province.
Secondly, the interests of its particular commerce.
Thirdly, the weakness of its interior forces. Fourthly, the
state of its finances.</p>

<p>1. The territory of Zealand consists of five or six islands,
two of which are moderately large, and the rest very
small. These islands are formed in the mouth of the
(Escaut) Scheldt, by the sea, or by the different branches
of the Scheldt itself. In case of a sudden invasion, these
islands separated from the Province of Holland by an arm
of the sea, are too unconnected to receive any immediate
assistance. Such an invasion is so much the more easy
for the English, as Zealand is very near them. They may
invade this Province even before a suspicion should be conceived
that the project had been formed. Who shall oppose
their enterprise? Shall it be the French, who are now
friendly? Dunkirk, it is true, is near enough, but what
forces are there at Dunkirk? The only naval force there,
consists of a few privateers, who could neither oppose an
armament escorted by British men-of-war, nor venture to
transport troops to oppose it, even supposing the invasion
was not made by surprise. Shall the Zealanders themselves
make a resistance to the English? But separated
from one another by waters, which would necessarily retard
their junction, the island of Walcheren, the principal of all,
would be in possession of the enemy before they could put
themselves in a posture to repel force by force. It is,
moreover, not only possible but easy to make a descent
upon Zealand by so many places, that the Zealanders with
their own forces alone could not defend effectually all the
passages. Eight thousand English, or even a smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
number would force the Zealanders everywhere, because
there is nowhere a fortress capable of holding out twelve
hours. The ports of Flushing and Veere are the only
ones which have any defence; but they are very far from
the state in which they ought to be, to stop an enemy determined
upon pillage, animated by revenge, and whom the
pleasure of doing mischief instigates forcibly. It is conceded
that if the English descended in Zealand, they would
be constrained to abandon it very soon; that they might
and would be driven from it in a few days; that the figure
which they would make would be neither glorious nor honorable,
and that their temerity would cost them dear; but
the disorder caused by an invasion remains after the expulsion
of the invaders. The people invaded are always the
victims of the evils which they have suffered, and these
evils, always considerable to the individuals, are seldom
compensated entirely. When an incendiary has burned
my house, whether he is punished or not, my house is consumed
and lost to me. The exactions, the pillage, and all
the abominations which follow the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coups de main</i> of an unbridled
soldiery, would be cruelly felt by the unfortunate
Zealanders, even after the perpetrators should be driven
out, or sacrificed to the public resentment.</p>

<p>2. The peculiar commerce of Zealand. This Province
has no other than that small commerce, which is known by
the name of the coasting trade. This kind of trade is considerable
in the Provinces of Holland, North Holland, and
Friesland. The number of vessels employed in these
three Provinces in this kind of trade is inconceivable, and
the greatest part of them is destined for the service of
France. All which France receives from foreigners, and
all which it furnishes to foreigners, is carried in these Holland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
vessels, and if there was no other than the freight for
the masters and owners of these vessels, this profit would
still be of the greatest consideration. Thus it is not surprising
that the Province of Holland has taken such strong
measures in favor of France. Its particular commerce
would naturally determine it this way. On the contrary,
Zealand employs the small number of her merchant ships
in a commerce with England, a commerce so much the
more lucrative, as it is almost entirely contraband or smuggled.</p>

<p>The profits to be made on brandy and other spirituous
liquors, imported clandestinely into England, are very considerable;
and it is Zealand that makes these profits, because
they are her subjects who entertain a continual correspondence
with the English smugglers. The proximity
of the coasts of Zealand to those of England, renders this
commerce, which is prohibited to English subjects, sure
for the inhabitants of Zealand. Fishing barks are sufficient
to carry it on, and these barks are rarely taken,
whether it is that they are difficult to take, or whether
there is not much desire to take them. These barks,
arrived upon the coasts of England, find others which
come to take what they bring. The place where this traffic
is held, is generally some creek upon the coast of
England, where the vessel may be loaded and unloaded in
secrecy. Moreover, those whom the English Ministry
appoint to prevent this commerce at sea, are those who favor
it. We know very well the decided inclination of the English
in general, and, above all, of their seamen for strong
liquors. Zealand, concurring openly in the measures, which
the Republic is now taking against England, or, if you will,
against the powers at war, would draw upon itself particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the hatred, anger, and vengeance of a nation, without
which it is impossible to sustain its trade, and this Province
would, by this means, deprive a great number of its subjects
of a source of gain, which places them in a condition
to furnish the imposts which they have to pay. Is it not
then the part of prudence in the States of Zealand, to avoid
with care everything that might embroil them, particularly
with England? Is it not also the wisdom of the States-General
to have a regard to the critical situation of one of
the Seven Provinces which compose the union?</p>

<p>3. The weakness of her internal forces. Zealand is
open on all sides to the English. To set them at defiance,
she ought to have in herself forces capable of intimidating
Great Britain. But where are such forces to be found?
In the garrisons, which the Republic maintains there? Two
or three thousand men dispersed at Flushing, at Veere,
and in some other cities, are but a feeble defence against
a descent of six or seven thousand English, well determined.
Will these troops of the Republic be supported
by armed citizens? Suppose it; their defeat will be not
less certain. These citizens, who have never seen a loaded
musket discharged, are more proper to carry an empty
fusil, to mount guard at a state-house, which is never to
be attacked, than to march to the defence of a coast threatened
with a descent, or to present themselves upon the
parapet of a fort, battered with machines that vomit forth
death. These citizens, or rather these soldiers of a moment,
would carry disorder into the ranks, and do more
injury than service, by giving countenance to the flight of
those brave warriors, who make it a point of honor to combat
with a steadfast foot. Moreover, who are these citizens,
which might be joined to the regular troops? Are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
they the principal inhabitants? Those who have the most
to lose? Those to whom birth and education have given
sentiments of honor and of glory? No. These have, by
paying sums of money, exemptions, which excuse them from
taking arms, to defend the country in time of peace. Is it
credible that in the most critical moments they will generously
renounce these exemptions? It will be, then,
the citizens of the second order, the artisans, or people
who have little or nothing to lose, who will serve for the
reinforcement to the veterans. Experience demonstrates
what dependence is to be placed at this day upon such
militia. It would be in vain to oppose to this the time of
the revolution, those times of the heroism of the ancestors
of the Dutch. The cause is not the same; they attack at
this day in a different fashion, and perhaps the defence too
would be made in a very different manner. It might be
otherwise, if the coasts of Zealand were fortified with good
forts, or if the cities of Flushing and Veere were in a condition
to sustain a siege of some months, and with their
little garrisons stop the assailants, until the arrival of succors.
But one must be very little informed not to know
that the English, although they should be incommoded in
their landing, would nevertheless effect it with little loss.</p>

<p>4. The state of her finances. Zealand, of all the Seven
Provinces, is that which costs the most for the maintenance
of her dykes. More exposed than all the others to be
drowned by the sea, her coasts require continual repairs.
These reparations cannot be made, but at great expense.
Unprovided with wood suitable for the construction of ramparts
capable of stopping the waves, which beat upon her
continually, she is obliged to import from foreigners those
numberless and enormous timbers, which art substitutes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the place of those rocks, which nature has granted to other
countries, for holding in the ocean and restraining its fury.
It is necessary, therefore, that a great part of the public
revenue of the Province should go to foreigners. She
must, moreover, furnish her quota to the general treasury
of the Republic; from whence it follows, that she cannot
expose herself to the indispensable necessity of increasing
her imposts, to furnish the new expenses, which an extraordinary
armament would bring upon all the State. More
than once, in time of peace, the public coffers of the State
have been obliged to furnish to the Province of Zealand,
the succors which she could not find at home, without reducing
her subjects to the most horrible distress. To what
condition, then, would those subjects be reduced, if in the
progress of the armed neutrality, such as is proposed, or in
a war with England, they should still be obliged to pay
new contributions? All the world agrees that Zealand
is poor; it must be acknowledged then that she will be
plunged in the lowest indigence, if the expenses of the
country are augmented, although there are many individuals
in Zealand who are very rich and grand capitalists,
and luxury among the great is carried to excess as immoderate
as it is in Holland. Zealand has so long embarrassed
the Republic in all their deliberations concerning the armed
neutrality, and lately concerning the serious quarrel, that
England has commenced against her, that I thought it
would at least gratify the curiosity of Congress to see the
causes which have governed, laid open, as I find them explained
in conversation and in public writers. Zealand's
reasons seem to be now overruled, and the Prince's absolute
authority there of little avail. To all appearances, the
English must recede, or contend with a bitter enemy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
this Republic. Old prejudices seem to wear off, and it is
now said publicly, that the friendship between the English
and Dutch has been like the brotherly love between Cain
and Abel; yet I can never depend upon anything here
until it is past, I have been so often disappointed in my
expectations.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, December 31st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It will scarcely be believed in Congress, that at a time
when there are the strongest appearances of war, there has
not been a newspaper nor a letter received in this city
from London, since the 19th or 20th of the month.
There are symptoms of a more general war. If Britain
adheres to her maxims, this Republic will demand the aid
of Russia, Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia, in pursuance
of the treaty of armed neutrality. These powers will not
be duped by the artifice of the British Court, and adjudge
this war not a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus f&oelig;deris</i>, when all the world agrees,
that the accession of the Republic to the armed neutrality
is the real cause of it, and the treaty between Mr Lee and
M. de Neufville, only a false pretence. If the armed
neutral confederacy takes it up, as nobody doubts they
will, all these powers will be soon at war with England, if
she does not recede. If the neutral powers do not take it
up and England proceeds, she will drive this Republic into
the arms of France, Spain, and America. In this possible
case, a Minister here from Congress would be useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>.
In case the armed neutrality take it up, a Minister
authorised to represent the United States to all the neutral
Courts, might be of use.</p>

<p>The Empress Queen is no more. The Emperor has
procured his brother Maximilian, to be declared coadjutor
of the bishopric of Munster and Cologne, which affects
Holland and the Low Countries. He is supposed to have
his eye on Liege; this may alarm the Dutch, the King of
Prussia and France. The war may become general, and
the fear of it may make peace, that is, it might if the King
of England was not the most determined man in the world.
But depressed, and distracted, and ruined as his dominions
are, he will set all Europe in a blaze before he will make
peace. His exertions, however, against us cannot be very
formidable. Patience, firmness, and perseverance are our
only remedies; these are sure and infallible ones, and with
this observation, I beg permission to take my leave of
Congress for the year 1780, which has been to me the
most anxious and mortifying year of my whole life. God
grant that more vigor, wisdom, and decision may govern
the councils, negotiations, and operations of mankind in the
year 1781.</p>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, January 1st, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The mail from London, arrived this morning, brought
us, for a new years' entertainment, the following</p>


<h4>MANIFESTO.</h4>

<p>"George R.&mdash;Through the whole course of our reign,
our conduct towards the States-General of the United
Provinces, has been that of a sincere friend and faithful
ally. Had they adhered to those wise principles, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
used to govern the Republic, they must have, shown themselves
equally solicitous to maintain the friendship, which
has so long subsisted between the two nations, and which
is essential to the interests of both; but from the prevalence
of a faction devoted to France, and following the
dictates of that Court, a very different policy has prevailed.
The return made to our friendship, for sometime past, has
been an open contempt of the most solemn engagements,
and a repeated violation of public faith.</p>

<p>"On the commencement of the defensive war, in which
we found ourselves engaged by the aggression of France,
we showed a tender regard for the interests of the States-General,
and a desire of securing to their subjects every
advantage of trade, consistent with the great and just principles
of our own defence. Our Ambassador was instructed
to offer a friendly negotiation, to obviate everything
that might lead to disagreeable discussion; and to
this offer, solemnly made by him to the States-General the
2d of November, 1778, no attention was paid. After the
number of our enemies was increased by the aggression of
Spain, equally unprovoked with that of France, we found
it necessary to call upon the States-General for the performance
of their engagements. The 5th article of the
perpetual defensive alliance between our Crown and the
States-General, concluded at Westminster, the 3d of
March, 1678, besides the general engagement for succors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
expressly stipulates, 'That that party of the two allies that
is not attacked, shall be obliged to break with the aggressor
in two months after the party attacked shall require
it.' Yet two years have passed, without the least
assistance given to us, without a single syllable in answer to
our repeated demands. So totally regardless have the
States been of their treaties with us, that they readily
promised our enemies to observe a neutrality in direct contradiction
to those engagements, and whilst they have
withheld from us the succors they were bound to furnish,
every secret assistance has been given to the enemy; and
inland duties have been taken off, for the sole purpose of
facilitating the carriage of naval stores to France.</p>

<p>"In direct and open violation of treaty, they suffered an
American pirate to remain several weeks in one of their
ports, and even permitted a part of his crew to mount
guard in a fort in the Texel.</p>

<p>"In the East Indies, the subjects of the States-General
in concert with France, have endeavored to raise up enemies
against us. In the West Indies, particularly at St Eustatia,
every protection and assistance has been given to our
rebellious subjects. Their privateers are openly received
in the Dutch harbors, allowed to refit there, supplied
with arms and ammunition, their crews recruited, their
prizes brought in and sold; and all this in direct violation of
as clear and solemn stipulations as can be made.</p>

<p>"This conduct, so inconsistent with all good faith, so
repugnant to the sense of the wisest part of the Dutch
nation, is chiefly to be ascribed to the prevalence of the
leading magistrates of Amsterdam, whose secret correspondence
with our rebellious subjects was suspected long
before it was made known by the fortunate discovery of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
treaty, the first article of which is, 'That there shall be a
firm, inviolable, and universal peace and sincere friendship
between their High Mightinesses the Estates of the Seven
United Provinces of Holland, and the United States of
North America, and the subjects and people of the said
parties; and between the countries, islands, cities, and
towns, situated under the jurisdiction of the said United
States of Holland, and the United States of America, and
the people and inhabitants thereof, of every degree, without
exception of persons or places.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>"This treaty was signed in September, 1778, by the
express order of the Pensionary of Amsterdam, and other
principal magistrates of that city. They now not only
avow the whole transaction, but glory in it, and expressly
say, even to the States-General, that what they did was
what their indispensable duty required. In the meantime,
the States-General declined to give any answer to the
Memorial presented by our Ambassador; and this refusal
was aggravated by their proceeding upon other business,
nay, upon the consideration of this very subject to internal
purposes; and while they found it impossible to approve
the conduct of their subjects, they still industriously avoided
to give us the satisfaction so manifestly due. We had
every right to expect, that such a discovery would have
roused them to a just indignation at the insult offered to us
and to themselves, and that they would have been eager to
give us full and ample satisfaction for the offence, and to
inflict the severest punishment upon the offenders. The
urgency of the business made an instant answer essential to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
the honor and safety of this country. The demand was
accordingly pressed by our Ambassador, in repeated conferences
with the Ministers, and in a second Memorial; it
was pressed with all the earnestness, that could proceed
from our ancient friendship, and the sense of recent injuries;
and the answer now given to a Memorial on such
a subject, presented more than five weeks ago, is, that the
States have taken it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad referendum</i>. Such an answer, upon
such an occasion could only be dictated by the fixed purpose
of hostility meditated and already resolved by the
States, induced by the offensive Councils of Amsterdam,
thus to countenance the hostile aggression, which the
magistrates of that city have made in the name of the Republic.</p>

<p>"There is an end of the faith of all treaties with them,
if Amsterdam may usurp the sovereign power, may violate
these treaties with impunity, by pledging the States to
engagements directly contrary, and leaguing the Republic
with the rebels of a sovereign to whom she is bound by
the closest ties. An infraction of the law of nations, by
the meanest member of any country, gives the injured
State a right to demand satisfaction and punishment; how
much more so, when the injury complained of is a flagrant
violation of public faith, committed by leading and predominant
members of the State? Since then the satisfaction
we have demanded is not given, we must, though most
reluctantly, do ourselves that justice, which we cannot
otherwise obtain.</p>

<p>"We must consider the States-General as parties in the
injury, which they will not repair, as sharers in the aggression,
which they refuse to punish, and must act accordingly.
We have, therefore, ordered our Ambassador to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
withdraw from the Hague, and shall immediately pursue
such vigorous measures as the occasion fully justifies, and
our dignity and the essential interest of our people require.
From a regard to the Dutch nation at large, we
wish it were possible to direct those measures wholly
against Amsterdam; but this cannot be, unless the States-General
will immediately declare, that Amsterdam shall
upon this occasion receive no assistance from them, but be
left to abide the consequences of its aggression.</p>

<p>"Whilst Amsterdam is suffered to prevail in the general
councils, and is backed by the strength of the State, it is
impossible to resist the aggression of so considerable a part,
without contending with the whole. But we are too sensible
of the common interests of both countries not to remember,
in the midst of such a contest, that the only point
to be aimed at by us, is to raise a disposition in the Councils
of the Republic to return to our ancient union, by
giving us that satisfaction for the past, and security for the
future, which we shall be as ready to receive, as they can
be to offer, and to the attainment of which we shall direct
all our operations. We mean only to provide for our own
security by defeating the dangerous designs that have been
formed against us. We shall ever be disposed to return to
friendship with the States-General, when they sincerely
revert to that system, which the wisdom of their ancestors
formed, and which has now been subverted by a powerful
faction, conspiring with France against the true interests of
the Republic, no less than against those of Great Britain.</p>

for executing the office of Lord High Admiral, to will
and require the High Court of Admiralty of Great Britain

or surrogates, as also the several Courts of Admiralty
within his Majesty's dominions, to take cognisance of, and
judicially proceed upon all manner of captures, seizures,
prizes, and reprisals of all ships and goods that are, or
shall be taken, and to hear and determine the same; and
according to law to judge and condemn all such ships,
vessels, and goods, as shall belong to the States-General of
the United Provinces, or their vassals and subjects, or to
any others inhabiting within any of the countries, territories,
and dominions of the aforesaid States-General; and
that such powers and clauses be inserted in said commission
as have been usual, and are according to former
precedents; and they are likewise to prepare, and lay
before his Majesty at this Board, a draft of such instructions
as may be proper to be sent to the Courts of Admiralty
in his Majesty's foreign governments and plantations,
for their guidance herein; as also another draft of instructions
for such ships as shall be commissioned for the purposes
aforementioned."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, January 4th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the influence of the English nation,
notwithstanding the influence of old prejudices and habits,
notwithstanding the apprehensions that are entertained for
immense sums in the English funds, and for the sudden
destruction of an innumerable navigation at the commencement
of a war; and above all, notwithstanding the authority
and influence of the Stadtholder, I am confidently assured
by several gentlemen, that the national opinion and
affection is with us. The Baron Van der Capellan, with
whom I have the honor of an agreeable acquaintance, is of
opinion, that four fifths of the nation wish us success in
our enterprise.</p>

<p>The symptoms of popularity in this city are decisive.
The Sunday before last, in the Presbyterian meeting, the
parson, beginning as usual to pray for the King of England,
was absolutely interrupted by a general murmur.
On Christmas day, he attempted to repeat his imprudence,
and was interrupted by still greater confusion; so that last
Sunday he had learned discretion to leave out wholly this
offensive clause. On the evening of new year's day, at
the theatre, the public were entertained with the national
tragedy, as it is called, <em>Gysbrecht Van Amstel</em>, after which
the actors, as is customary, addressed the audience.
There were many strokes in this address, which sufficiently
indicated the spirit of the times, particularly a solemn
injunction, that "they must not be slaves," and a quotation
from a very popular song, with which the streets have rung
these ten days, which were deeply and universally applauded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>The presses swarm with pamphlets, handbills, songs,
and poems, generally much against the English, and commonly
with some favorable hints to Americans. The conversation
in private families, and the toasts in jovial circles,
indicate a tremendous spirit in the body of this people,
which, if once let loose from restraint, and properly
directed, would make this nation the worst enemy that
England ever had. It is essential to attend to these
symptoms of popularity at this time, and in this country,
because it is manifest, that the whole system of the English,
in concert with their faction in the Republic, is now
bent to excite the populace against the burgomasters of
Amsterdam. They succeeded in 1748, and accomplished
a change in the Regency. If they could succeed in the
same manner now, they would change the political system
of this nation entirely, and by this means, in the present
situation of affairs in Europe and America, it is plain, they
would work its entire and irretrievable ruin.</p>

<p>Yet the course is so circuitous, to apply to the Courts
of Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, to induce them to join
in demanding satisfaction of England, the shocks upon
'Change will be so great, by the sudden capture of so many
ships, so many ensurers, merchants, &amp;c. will be ruined,
and there will be so many arts to divide and discourage
this people, that I cannot pretend to foresee what will happen.
The confusion is yet so great, that I have no hopes
at present of obtaining money. There must be time for
the fermentation to go off; and the quarrel with England
must become in the minds of all irreconcilable, before we
can try the experiment whether we have any credit or not.</p>

<p>If Congress should think proper to send powers here to
treat with the States-General, I beg leave to submit to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
consideration the case of M. Dumas. He was early employed
in our affairs here, has neglected all other business,
has been attentive and industrious, and is a gentleman of
extensive learning and amiable character. I believe he is
not ambitious or avaricious, but moderate in his expectations.
Whoever shall be honored with powers from Congress
to reside here would find his assistance useful, for he
is much devoted to the American cause; I hope, therefore,
that Congress will pardon me if I venture to recommend
him to their attention.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, January 14th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>In an excursion, which I have lately made through the
principal cities of this Province, Haerlem, Leyden, the
Hague, and Rotterdam, I have had an opportunity of perceiving
that there is a spirit of resentment against the English
very general among the people. Notwithstanding this,
everything is so artfully retarded, the manifesto, the letters
of marque, and above all, the decision of the Court of Justice
of Holland is so studiously delayed, while the English
are making such vast depredations upon the defenceless
merchant vessels, that I cannot yet be sure that war is decided.
The counsels of the Prince, united with those of
the proprietors in British funds, and the distresses of merchants
may yet induce the Republic, against the general
sense of the nation, to sue for a dishonorable peace.</p>

<p>I have received a letter, however, since my return, from
M. Dumas of last Friday, which informs me that a letter
is received from the Plenipotentiaries at Petersburg, dated
the 19th of December, announcing that the Empress of
Russia was well satisfied with all that had passed; that she
had seen the two last Memorials presented by Sir Joseph
Yorke to their High Mightinesses, and that she had more
indignation than surprise at the sight of them; (it may be
doubted, however, whether this is not a mistake, as the last
Memorial was dated the 12th, and the letter of the Minister
the 19th,) that the signature was to be on the 23d, after
which, these Ministers were to display the character of
Ambassadors Extraordinary, and that they would forthwith
despatch another express with the convention signed. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
express is now expected every moment, and as soon as he
arrives, their High Mightinesses will publish the Manifesto.
This little delay is but a pure formality. In the meantime,
they resolved on the 12th of this month to distribute letters
of marque to privateers, and orders to the ships of the
State, to seize everything they can belonging to the English.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, there are no privateers ready, and
I fear there are fewer ships of war ready than there ought
to be. It will be long before the Dutch can do any great
things, and they must suffer very severely. Such are the
effects of blind and mistaken policy. War is so new and
so terrible a thing to this people, they are so divided in
sentiment, their minds are so agitated with uncertainty,
irresolution, and apprehension, that there is as yet no possibility
of borrowing any money.</p>

<p>I must therefore repeat the request, that Congress would
not think upon drawing for any more money here, until
they receive certain advices from me, that there is some in
hand.</p>

Amsterdam, January 15th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The following is the declaration of the States-General,
of their accession to the armed neutrality.</p>


<h4>DECLARATION.</h4>

<p>"Their High Mightinesses, the States-General of the
United Provinces of the Low Countries, having had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
more at heart, since the commencement of the present war,
and having desired nothing more earnestly, than to observe
invariably the most strict and the most perfect neutrality
between the belligerent powers, and to fulfil at the same
time their essential and indispensable obligations by granting
a convenient protection to the commerce and the navigation
of their subjects, and by maintaining and defending the
rights and liberties of their neutral flag, have learned with
the highest satisfaction, that her Majesty, the Empress of
all the Russias, constantly animated with noble and generous
sentiments, which must transmit to the latest posterity
the immortal lustre and renown of her glorious reign, has
thought fit to declare to the belligerent powers, 'That being
in the intention to observe during the present war the most
exact impartiality, she is determined to maintain, by all the
means the most efficacious, the honor of the Russian flag,
as well as the safety of the commerce and the navigation
of her subjects, and not to suffer any of the belligerent
powers to give them any interruption.' The sentiments
and the views of their High Mightinesses answer perfectly,
and are entirely conformable to the principles, which make
the basis of the declaration of her Imperial Majesty; and
they consequently do not hesitate to lay open, after her
example, to the belligerent powers, the same principles,
which they are determined to follow, and to maintain in
concert with her Imperial Majesty; viz.</p>

<p>"1st. That neutral vessels may freely navigate from
port to port, and upon the coasts of the powers at war.</p>

<p>"2dly. That the effects belonging to the subjects of the
powers at war, shall be free upon neutral vessels, excepting
only merchandises of contraband.</p>

<p>"3dly. That with regard to contraband, their High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
Mightinesses adhere to what is stipulated by the treaties
concluded between them and the belligerent powers, and
more expressly, by the sixth article of the treaty of marine
with the Crown of Spain of the 17th of December, 1650;
the third article of the treaty of marine with the Crown of
England of the 1st of December, 1674; and the sixteenth
article of the treaty of commerce, of navigation and of
marine with the Crown of France of the 1st of December,
1739, for twentyfive years. The dispositions and determinations
of which treaties, in their full extent relative to
merchandises of contraband, their High Mightinesses consider
as entirely founded on natural equity and the law of
nations.</p>

<p>"4thly. That no place shall be adjudged blockaded, but
when ships of war, stationed in the neighborhood, shall
hinder, that no vessel can enter without evident danger.</p>

<p>"5thly. That these principles shall serve as rules to
judge of the lawfulness or the unlawfulness of prizes.</p>

<p>"As these principles form and constitute the universal
rights of neutral powers, and as they are, moreover, confirmed
by treaties which can never be lawfully annulled or
altered, or suspended but by a common act, and reciprocal
consent of the contracting parties, their High Mightinesses
flatter themselves, that the belligerent powers will acknowledge
and respect the justice of them, by giving no obstruction
to the commerce of the subjects of their High Mightinesses,
and by not troubling them in the free enjoyment
of rights, the propriety of which cannot be contested, to the
flag of neutral and independent powers."</p>

Amsterdam, January 15th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Zealand is still endeavoring to divert the Republic from
its interest and its duty, to embarrass its operations, and
involve it in disgrace and ruin.</p>

<p>The Directors of the Company of Commerce, and that
of Ensurance, and a great number of merchants, established
at Middleburg, in Zealand, have presented a petition
to the States-General, to supplicate their High Mightinesses
to try again the way of negotiation, and to endeavor to
prevent by this means the damages with which the subjects
of the Republic are still threatened, by a war with England,
and to come to a friendly accommodation. This
petition has been supported by a resolution of the States
of Zealand, transmitted to the Assembly of the States-General;
but it is said, that this petition has been rendered
commissorial, and will not be taken into consideration, unless
the English should make some propositions of peace.
The state of the Marine of this Republic, during the year
1781, as it has been proposed by the petition of the Council
of State, is, two vessels of seventy guns, and five hundred
and fifty men; nine of sixty guns, and four hundred
and fifty men; fifteen of fifty guns, and three hundred
men; two of forty guns, and two hundred and seventy
men; one of forty guns, and two hundred and fifty men;
fourteen of thirtysix guns, and two hundred and thirty men;
thirteen of twenty guns, and one hundred and fifty men;
five sloops, one hospital ship, four packet boats, twelve
large armed vessels, sixteen smaller; making in the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
ninetyfour ships, and eighteen thousand four hundred and

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, January 16th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The Prince, on the 26th of December, made a proposition
to the States-General, viz. in substance, "That His
Most Serene Highness had already communicated the last
year to the respective Provinces his advice, to equip fifty
or sixty vessels of war, and to augment the land forces to
fifty or sixty thousand men, to put the frontier places in a
good state of defence, and to provide necessary magazines
of warlike stores, to the end, to be in a condition to defend
the lawful rights of the Republic; that His Most Serene
Highness had seen with satisfaction, that as far as respected
the marine, it had been made better in some degree; and
that he flattered himself, that the States of all the Provinces
would reinforce it for the ensuing year, with redoubled
zeal, since they could not be too much upon their
guard in the present conjuncture; that it was equally necessary
to put the Republic in a convenient state of defence,
on the land side; and that he hoped, that they
would at this day think seriously of it; that they would
augment the fortifications, and supply the magazines, since,
if they failed in this, His Most Serene Highness would not
be responsible for the events, &amp;c."</p>

<p>The States-General, after having thanked the Stadtholder,
for his assiduous zeal and solicitude to maintain the
Republic in the enjoyment of its liberty and independence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
resolved, "That the proposition of His Most Serene Highness
should be communicated to the respective Provinces,
and that it should be represented to them, that His Most
Serene Highness, animated with the purest love of his
country, insists with reason (at this day when the danger is
immediate, and war appears inevitable) upon the necessity
of making unanimous efforts, to the end to resist this danger,
and to preserve the Republic, by joining courage to
prudence; that the maritime forces of the Republic are
not yet sufficient to protect the commerce, the source of
the well being of the public in all its branches, and to ensure
from all invasion the possessions of the Republic, both
in the East and the West Indies; that, therefore, their
High Mightinesses think themselves under obligation to
pray the members of the union, in a manner the most
friendly and the most pressing, to fix their attention as
soon as possible upon these objects, and to accomplish
them with vigor, since the storm, which approaches at sea,
may easily, by a sudden revolution, discharge itself upon
the continent, so that an augmentation of land forces is as
indispensably necessary, as the armament by sea; that
from these motives, their High Mightinesses assure themselves,
that since there no longer remains for the Republic
a choice between peace and war, the respective members
of the union will endeavor, as far as possible to defend
their country, and all which is dear to them, by acting with
unanimity, courage, and candor."</p>

<p>Congress will not expect me to write upon the subject
of peace at this time, when the flames of war are spreading
far and wide, with more rapidity than ever, and I have
no comfortable tidings on the subject of money.</p>

<p>In the first place, I believe there is not so much money
here as the world imagines; in the next place, those who
have what there is, have now no confidence in any nation
or individual. All credit seems at a stand.</p>

<p>The Republic will want a loan; the northern neutral
powers will want loans, and even a loan will be wanted to
support the credit of a number of houses in the mercantile
way, which are affected by the violent and sudden revolution
of the times, and by the piratical depredations of the
English. I hope, therefore, that Congress will not venture
to draw here, until they have certain information that

<p>At length one act has appeared, which looks like war.
The following placard was resolved on the 12th of this
month.</p>

<p>"The States-General of the United Provinces of the
Low Countries to all those who shall see, hear, or read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
these presents. Greeting. Know ye, that the King of
Great Britain having thought proper, without any lawful
cause, to attack in a hostile manner this Republic, and as
we are obliged to neglect nothing, which can serve for our
defence, and to use at the same time the right, the example
of which the conduct of the said Crown has commenced
by setting us, and to act against it, in the same manner as
they act against us, and consequently to do to the said
King, and to his subjects, all the prejudice, which shall be in
our power; for these causes, and for the protection of the
commerce and of the navigation of this country, we have
thought fit to establish, and to permit to all the subjects of
these States, who shall take or destroy any English vessels
of war, or privateers, the following rewards.</p>

<p>I. "All those who shall fit out a privateer, and shall
have obtained of his Highness the Prince of Orange and
Nassau, in quality of Admiral-General of these countries,
suitable commissions, after having given beforehand the
requisite securities, shall not be held to furnish the third
man of their crew, as it is ordained by the placard of
their High Mightinesses, of the 26th of June, 1780, excepting
those who will load with merchandises, and take at
the same time the said letters of marque. Those, who
shall have taken and conducted into one of the ports, or
roads, within the jurisdiction of one of the Colleges of
Admiralty of this country, a vessel of war or privateer of
the King of Great Britain, shall draw, moreover, a bounty
of one hundred and fifty florins for each man, who shall
be found at the commencement of the combat on board of
the said vessel of war, or privateer, as also a like sum for
each pound of ball which the artillery, which shall be
found on board the said vessel at the time aforesaid, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
discharge at one time, not including the swivels, or the
balls of the new artillery, called carronades, valued only at
one quarter of their weight; in such sort, that if one of
our privateers shall make herself master of an English
vessel of war, or privateer mounted, for example, with
forty pieces of cannon, carrying altogether three hundred
and fifty pound weight of ball, that is to say, forty carronades,
and fourteen hundred balls of eight pound, and the
crew of which shall be two hundred and twenty men, shall
receive for bounty or reward, by calculating each man and
each pound of ball upon the footing of one hundred and
fifty florins, the sum of eightyfive thousand eight hundred
florins, and thus more or less in proportion to the crew;
and the caliber of the cannon, which shall be found at the
time of the combat, upon the English ship, besides the
booty and the prize, and all the effects which shall be
found on board, without any other deduction to be made
from it, than the tenth for the Admiral.</p>

<p>II. "The said recompenses assigned for prizes shall
also take place in case the English vessel of war, or privateer,
shall be totally destroyed, whether our armed vessel
shall have sunk her, or burnt her, or shipwrecked her, or
whether the said vessel shall have perished in any other
manner, after having been taken; provided, nevertheless,
that this recompense is not to be claimed in the whole, at
least if the crew of the vessel destroyed has not been
taken or killed. And if it should happen, that they have
only driven the enemy's vessel on shore, so that the vessel
has perished, but the crew has saved itself, our letters of
marque shall not enjoy, in this case, but one half of the
bounty or reward promised; so that in the case last
mentioned they shall receive only fortytwo thousand nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
hundred florins, instead of eightyfive thousand eight hundred.</p>

<p>III. "Provided, nevertheless, that neither the prize nor
the bounty shall ever be adjudged to any of our letters of
marque, until after the affair shall have been carried before
one of the Colleges of the Admiralty of this country, and
the sentence shall have been there pronounced in her favor.</p>

<p>IV. "The said Colleges of the Admiralty may not adjudge
these rewards, until after the Captain, Lieutenant,
and Pilot of the privateer, as well as those who shall
have freighted her, their book-keepers, and others authorised,
shall have declared by a solemn oath, that the vessel
of war, or privateer, of which they have made themselves
masters, has been duly taken without any collusion directly
or indirectly with the English, or with any other known
to them. In case the freighters, who claim the adjudication
of prizes and bounties, are out of the country, absent,
or hindered by some other obstacle, it shall suffice, that
the book-keepers, or some other authorised, take the oath,
but so far as it is of his knowledge for himself, and for
his freighters, conformably to the special procuration, which
he shall have for this effect; the freighters nevertheless
shall be obliged to take an oath beforehand before the
magistrate of their residence, or before other persons competent,
whose testimonies they shall send.</p>

<p>V. "And for the better encouragement of the said
ships, which shall have armed as privateers, we ordain,
that those who shall have been wounded in a combat with
the English ship, shall be maintained at the expense of the
State, without its costing anything to the proprietors of the
privateers, or those who shall be on board. We ordain
also, that those who shall be maimed in fighting an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
ship, shall be gratified on the part of the State, and without
its costing anything to the freighters, with the moiety of the
recompense granted by the Republic to those who serve
on board vessels of war; they shall not, however, have a
right but to those rewards which are given once, and not
to those which shall be granted weekly, or monthly, or
otherwise. As to what respects the maintenance of the
wounded, the account of it shall be presented to the competent
College of the Admiralty, to be there examined and
duly regulated, so that the maimed, to the end that they
may enjoy the moiety of the recompense proposed, may
procure themselves an act of the said College of the Admiralty,
after having furnished it the necessary proofs.</p>

<p>VI. "For the encouragement of the ships of war,
as well as the merchant vessels, which may be provided
with commissions to make use of, in case of need, to
cause to the English ships all the prejudice possible, we
intend that the English ship of which they may make themselves
masters, of what nature or denomination soever it
may be, shall be given them entire, the tenth for the Admiral
excepted, without pretending, however, to any further
recompense.</p>

<p>VII. "If it should happen, that our privateers, merchant
vessels, or others armed for a cruise at the expense
of individuals of this country, should retake any vessels or
effects belonging to the subjects of the State, and that such
recapture shall be made in the space of fortyeight hours
after they shall have been in the hands of the enemy, they
shall enjoy in that case one fifth of the just value of the
vessels or effects, which they shall have delivered; but if
the recapture shall be made in the space of four days after
the vessel shall have been in the hands of the English, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
shall have one third of the said value; and if the recapture
shall be made after four days, they shall have the
moiety of it, without having any further regard to the
greater or lesser time, that the said vessels or effects retaken
shall have been in the hands of the English, after
the expiration of the four days.</p>

<p>VIII. "The adjudication of any one of the said recompenses,
as well as the acts of the respective Colleges of the
Admiralty in favor of the maimed or wounded, being shown
to the Receiver-General of the duties of entry and clearance,
to receive the appointed recompense, the payment of
it shall be promptly made by the said Receiver-General at
the Hague, or in the place of the College of Admiralty, in
which the sentence or the taxation shall have been pronounced,
as it shall be most convenient for the said Receiver-General.</p>

<p>IX. "Which Receiver-General shall be provided with
sufficient sums of money to satisfy the said payments, and
he shall always take care, that after having paid some
bounties, he has always wherewith to satisfy promptly those
which may be demanded of him in the sequel, either by
the second moiety of the duties of Last and Vielgeld, or by
negotiating successively the sums which he shall have occasion
for, for a supply.</p>

<p>X. "In all cases, the privateer, who shall have taken
or destroyed any English vessel, ought to take care to give
without delay, and as soon as he arrives, notice to the said
Receiver-General of the value of the bounties, which he
has a right to claim, to the end that the said Receiver-General
may be in a condition to make prompt payment.</p>

<p>XI. "And in all the respective Colleges of Admiralty,
where the case shall be brought, they shall take care to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
render prompt sentences, even by postponing to other
times the other affairs which may be before them.</p>

<p>XII. "And in case an appeal or revision should be demanded,
and by this means the sentences of the said Colleges
shall be annulled, we have desired that in this case,
the recompenses assigned by the sentences of the Admiralty
should be delivered to the said privateers, so that the
demand of revision may not suspend or hinder the payment;
we mean at the same time, that the sureties, which
the ships going to cruise ought to furnish, shall be obliged
in that case to augment the surety, and to promise a prompt
restitution of what shall have been paid to the said privateers
in consequence of sentences of the Admiralty, in case
that these sentences shall be reversed in the revision, and
the privateers denied their demand. And to be the more
sure that the sums delivered in such cases be restored, we
have declared, and do declare by these presents, that the
vessels and all which belongs to them, with which the said
prizes shall have been made, shall be held judicially to
make restitution of the bounties received; and that the
said juridical obligation shall commence from the day that
the said privateers shall have received their commissions,
and shall go upon a cruise.</p>

<p>XIII. "And this placard shall have its effects from the
day of this publication; and that nobody may pretend
ignorance, we request and demand the Lords, the States,
the Stadtholder, the Counsellors, Committees, and the
Deputies of the States of the respective Provinces of Guelderland,
and the Earldom of Zutphen, of Holland, and
West Friesland, of Zealand, of Utrecht, of Friesland, of
Overyssel, and of Groningen and Ommelanden, and all
other members and officers of justice, that they announce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
publish, and post up this ordinance immediately, in all the
places of this country, where it is customary to make such
annunciations, publications, and postings; we charge and
enjoin moreover, the Counsellors of the Admiralty, the
Advocates of the Treasury, Secretaries-General of Convoys,
and Licensers, Receivers, Masters of Convoys, Controllers,
and Searchers, and at the same time the Receiver-General
of the augmentation of the duty of Last and Vielgeld,
and to all others to whom it belongs, to govern themselves
exactly according to the tenor of these presents."</p>

<p>Their High Mightinesses have also published the following.</p>

<p>"The States-General of the United Provinces to all
those who shall see, hear, or read these presents. Greeting.
We make known, that to the end to encourage
the loyal inhabitants of this State, we have thought proper
by the present publication, to notify to all and every
one, and to assure them that all those who, employed in
the service of the Republic, in the war at sea, may be
maimed in such a manner as to become incapable of gaining
their livelihood by labor, and shall desire to be assisted
by a sum of money, payable once for all, shall receive in
proportion to the importance of their wounds, that which
follows.</p>

<p>1. "For the loss of two eyes, fifteen hundred florins;
for the loss of one eye, three hundred and fifty florins; as
to other accidents, which may happen under the case mentioned,
gratifications shall be given according to the good
pleasure of the respective Colleges of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>2. "For the loss of two arms, fifteen hundred florins;
for the loss of the right arm, four hundred and fifty florins;
for that of the left arm, three hundred and fifty florins;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
and for other accidents and wounds in these members, at
the discretion of the Colleges of the Admiralty, upon which
each one depends.</p>

<p>3. "For the loss of two hands, twelve hundred florins;
for the loss of the right hand, three hundred and fifty florins;
for that of the left hand, three hundred and fifty florins;
as to lesser accidents, valuable at sums less considerable,
at the discretion aforementioned.</p>

<p>4. "For the loss of two legs, seven hundred florins;
for the loss of one leg, three hundred and fifty florins; for
accidents less serious, the gratification shall be fixed by the
Colleges of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>5. "For the loss of two feet, four hundred and fifty
florins; for that of one foot, two hundred florins; and for
smaller wounds, at the discretion of the respective Colleges.</p>

<p>6. "Moreover, all those who in the service of the Republic
shall be maimed to such a degree as to be no longer
able to gain a living by labor, nor to provide in any manner
for their subsistence, shall receive during their lives, one
ducatoon a week; and all other wounds or mutilations
less considerable shall be paid in proportion."</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, February 1st, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>One of the most brilliant events, which has yet been
produced by the American Revolution, is the following
Treaty of Marine, concluded at Copenhagen, the 28th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
June, 1780, old style, between her Majesty, the Empress
of Russia, and his Majesty, the King of Denmark and of
Norway, for the maintenance of neutral mercantile navigation,
and in which his Majesty, the King of Sweden, as
well as their High Mightinesses, the States-General of the
United Provinces, have taken part and acceded, and
which has been signed respectively, at St Petersburg, the
21st of July, 1780, and the 5th of January, 1781.</p>


<h4>TREATY OF MARINE BETWEEN RUSSIA AND DENMARK.</h4>

<p>"As by the war by sea, which has actually broken out
between Great Britain, on one side, and France and Spain
on the other, the commerce and the navigation of neutral
powers suffer considerable damages, her Majesty, the Empress
of Russia, and his Majesty, the King of Denmark
and of Norway, in consequence of their assiduous attention
to unite their proper dignities, and their cares for the
safety and the well being of their subjects, from the regard
which they have so often testified for the rights of nations
in general, have found it necessary, in the present circumstances,
to determine their conduct according to those sentiments.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty, the Empress of Russia has, by her declaration,
dated the 28th of February, 1780, to the belligerent
powers, exposed to light, in the face of all Europe,
the fundamental principles, which spring from the original
law of nations, which she claims, and which she adopts as
a rule of her conduct in the present war. As this attention
of the Empress, to watch over the reciprocal rights of
nations, has united the suffrages of all the neutral powers,
so she has engaged herself in it, as an affair, which concerns
the most essential of her interests, and she has carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
it to that length, that we may seriously consider it as
a subject worthy of the times present and to come, considering
that it is to bring into one system, and establish
permanently, the rights, prerogatives, and engagements of
neutrality.</p>

<p>"His Majesty, the King of Denmark and of Norway,
convinced of these principles, has likewise established and
demanded them in the declaration of the 8th of July,
1780, which he has caused to be presented, as well as
that of Russia, to the belligerent powers; and to give
them support, he has caused to be equipped a part of his
fleet. From hence has arisen the harmony and unanimity,
with which her Majesty, the Empress of Russia, and his
Majesty, the King of Denmark and of Norway, have
judged necessary, by a reciprocal friendship and confidence,
and conformably to the interests of their subjects,
to confirm these common engagements, to be concluded
by a formal convention. In this view, their said Imperial
and Royal Majesties have chosen and named for their
Plenipotentiaries, viz. her Majesty, the Empress of Russia,
M. Charles Van Osten, named Saken, present Counsellor
of State, Knight of the Order of St Anne, Minister Plenipotentiary
of her said Majesty to the Court of Denmark,
&amp;c. &amp;c.; and his Majesty, the King of Denmark and of
Norway, M. Otton, Count de Thott, Privy Counsellor,
Knight of the Order of the Elephant, &amp;c.; M. Joachim
Otton de Schack-Reventlaw, Privy Counsellor, Knight of
the Order of the Elephant, &amp;c.; M. Jean Henri d'Eichstedt,
Privy Counsellor, Governor of his Royal Highness,
the Hereditary Prince, Knight of the Order of the Elephant,
&amp;c.; and M. André Pierre, Count de Bernstorff,
Privy Counsellor, Secretary of State of the Department of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
Foreign Affairs, Director of the Royal German Chancery,
and Knight of the Order of the Elephant, &amp;c.; who, after
having exchanged their full powers, which are found in
good and due form, have agreed and resolved upon the
Articles following.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article i.</span> That their said Majesties have sincerely
resolved to maintain constantly the most perfect friendship
and concord with the powers actually engaged in the war,
and to observe the most scrupulous neutrality; that they
declare, in consequence, to hold themselves exactly to this,
that the prohibition to carry on commerce of contraband
with the powers actually at war, or with those, who may
in the sequel be engaged in it, shall be strictly observed by
their subjects.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. ii.</span> To avoid all error and misunderstanding
concerning the subject of the name of contraband, her
Majesty, the Empress of Russia, and his Majesty, the
King of Denmark and Norway declare, that they acknowledge
only as effects of contraband, those which are comprehended
in the treaties subsisting between the said
Courts, and one or the other of the belligerent powers.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty, the Empress of Russia, conforms herself
entirely to the tenth and eleventh articles of her treaty of
commerce with Great Britain, and extends also the engagements
of this treaty, which are entirely founded upon
natural law, to the Crowns of France and Spain, which at
the date of the present convention, have no treaty of commerce
with her empire. His Majesty, the King of Denmark
and Norway conforms himself, on his part, principally
to the second article of his treaty of commerce with
Great Britain, and to the twentysixth and twentyseventh
articles of his treaty of commerce with France, and extends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
also the engagements of this latter to Spain, considering
that he has not with this last Crown any treaty, which
determines any conditions upon this subject.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. iii.</span> As by this means the contraband is determined
and fixed, conformably to special treaties and
conventions subsisting between the high contracting parties
and the belligerent powers, and principally in the treaty between
Russia and Great Britain, of the 20th of June,
1766, as well as by that between Denmark and Great
Britain, dated the 11th of July, 1670, and by that concluded
between Denmark and France, the 23d of August,
1742, the will and intention of her Russian Imperial Majesty,
and his Majesty the King of Denmark and Norway
are, that all other commerce shall be, and remain free.</p>

<p>"Already their Majesties, in their declarations presented
to the belligerent powers, have grounded themselves upon
the general principles of the law of nature, from whence
are derived the liberty of commerce and of navigation, the
rights of neutral nations, and have resolved to depend no
longer upon the arbitrary interpretations, that partial advantages
and momentary interests may dictate. In this
view, they have agreed upon the following articles.</p>

<p>"1. That it shall be lawful for every vessel to navigate
from one port to another, and upon the coasts of the belligerent
powers.</p>

<p>"2. That the effects belonging to the subjects of the belligerent
powers shall be free upon neutral vessels, except
merchandises of contraband.</p>

<p>"3. That to determine what ought to be held a port
blocked, that alone can be considered as such, in which the
vessels, which would enter, shall be exposed to an evident
danger, by the force, which with this view attacks it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
by its vessels, which shall have taken a station sufficiently
near.</p>

<p>"4. That neutral vessels may only be stopped for just
causes, and upon evident proofs; that, without loss of
time, right shall be done them, and the procedures shall
be always uniform, prompt, and according to the laws;
and that every time, besides reparation to those who shall
have suffered without cause, there shall be also given a
complete satisfaction for the insult committed against the
flags of their Majesties.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. iv.</span> To the end to protect the general commerce
of their subjects, supported by the fundamental
rules above laid down, her Majesty, the Empress of all the
Russias, and his Majesty, the King of Denmark and Norway,
have thought fit, each one in particular, in order to
obtain these ends, to equip a proportional number of
vessels of war and frigates. The squadron of each one of
these respective powers shall be stationed in a certain latitude,
and shall be employed in convoys, according to the
exigence of the case, in which the commerce and the navigation
of each nation may be.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. v.</span> If the merchant ships of one of the contracting
powers shall be in a part of the sea where the ships
of war of their own nation are not stationed, and, for this
reason, cannot enjoy their protection; in that case, the
commander of the vessels of war of the other power, being
thereto required, shall grant them, with good faith and sincerity,
the necessary assistance; and in this case, the
vessels of war and frigates of one of the two powers, shall
protect and support the merchant vessels of the other;
provided, nevertheless, that, under the shelter of the protection
demanded, there be not exercised any prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
commerce, contrary to the laws adopted by the neutrality.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. vi.</span> The present convention cannot be retroactive,
and, by consequence, we cannot take part in differences,
which have arisen before its conclusion; at least, if
these affairs do not concern the violences which continue
still, and which tend to oppress all the neutral nations of
Europe.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. vii.</span> If, in spite of the vigilant and friendly care
of the two powers, and the exact observation of the neutrality
on their part, the Russian or Danish merchant
vessels are insulted, or taken by the vessels of war, or privateers,
of one or the other of the belligerent powers, in
that case, the Minister of the party offended shall make
representations to the Court, whose vessels of war or privateers
shall have been guilty of this act, shall demand the
restoration of the vessel taken, and shall insist upon a
suitable reparation, without ever losing sight of the satisfaction
for the insult done to the flag. The Minister of the
other contracting party shall second efficaciously and seriously
these representations, and shall thus continue them
conjointly and unanimously; but if they refuse, or put off
from time to time to do right, touching such grievances,
in this case, their Majesties shall make reprisals against the
power which refuses to do them right, and shall unite
themselves forthwith, in the most efficacious measures for
this just reprisal.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. viii.</span> If one or the other of the contracting
powers, or both together, in virtue of this convention, or
any other which may be made, which may have relation to it,
are disturbed, molested, or attacked, it is agreed that the
two powers shall act in concert, to defend themselves reciprocally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
and to procure themselves, by united efforts, an
entire and satisfactory reparation, both for the insult done
to the flag, and for the loss caused to their subjects.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. ix.</span> This Convention is resolved and fixed for
all the time that the present war shall continue, and shall
serve as the basis of all the engagements which may be
contracted in the sequel, according to the circumstances
of the times, and upon occasion of new wars at sea, which
may unfortunately trouble the repose of Europe; besides,
these conditions shall be regarded as subsisting, and shall
have a legal validity in the affairs both of commerce and
navigation, and in the determination of the rights of neutral
nations.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. x.</span> As the end and the principal motive of this
Convention is, to assure the general liberty of commerce
and of navigation, her Majesty, the Empress of Russia, and
his Majesty, the King of Denmark and of Norway, agree
and engage beforehand, to permit that other neutral powers
accede to this convention, and by taking cognizance of
these principles, to partake also of the obligations and
advantages of the said convention.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. xi.</span> To the end that the belligerent powers
may not pretend a cause of ignorance of these said engagements
between the said Courts, the high contracting
parties will communicate in a manner the most friendly to
all the belligerent powers these maxims, in which they
have united, which measures are so much the less hostile,
as they are not hurtful to any other power; but have
solely for their object the safety of the commerce and of
the navigation of their respective subjects.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art. xii.</span> The present Convention shall be ratified
by the two contracting parties, and the ratifications shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
be exchanged in good form in the term of six weeks, to
be computed from the signatures, or even sooner; if it may
be. In faith of which we have, in virtue of our full powers,
signed the present, and, sealed it with our seals. Done
at Copenhagen, the nineteenth of July, 1780.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; H. EICHSTEDT."<br />
</p>

<p>The ratifications of this Convention were exchanged at
Copenhagen the 16th of September, 1780, by the same
Ministers Plenipotentiary who signed it, and as to this end,
the Ministers Plenipotentiary named to this purpose, viz.
on the part of her Imperial Majesty, the Count Nikia
Panin, actually Privy Counsellor, Senator, Chamberlain in
Exercise, and Knight of the Orders of St Andrew, St
Alexander Newsky, and St Anne, and the Count John Osterman,
Vice Chancellor, Privy Counsellor, and Knight of
the Orders of St Alexander Newsky and St Anne; and on
the part of his Majesty the King of Sweden, the Baron
Frederick Van Nalken, Envoy Extraordinary of his Swedish
Majesty at the Court of her Imperial Majesty, Chamberlain,
Commandant of the Order of the Polar Star,
Knight of the Orders of the Sword and of St John, have
signed, the 21st of July, 1780, at St Petersburg, a similar
Convention, conceived in the same form, and word for
word, of the same tenor with that signed at Copenhagen,
except the second article, in which the stipulations of contraband
being resolved and ratified, to which they are to
adhere, in consequence of treaties subsisting between the
Crown of Sweden and the other powers, we have to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
purpose, to avoid the repetition of what has been already
said, added here, literally, the said second article.</p>

<p>We ought further to recollect, that the two Kings, who
have joined in this affair to her Imperial Majesty, have
acceded as principal contracting parties to the treaties concluded
between her Imperial Majesty and the said Courts,
and have signed with their own hands upon this subject on
one part and the other, an act, which has been exchanged
at St Petersburg by the Ministry of her Imperial Russian
Majesty.</p>

<p>Here follows the second article of the treaty concluded
and signed at Petersburg, the 21st of July, 1780, between
her Imperial Majesty and his Majesty the King of Sweden.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art ii.</span> To avoid all error and misunderstanding on
the subject of the name of contraband, her Imperial Majesty
of Russia and his Majesty the King of Sweden declare,
that they acknowledge only as effects of contraband
those which are contained in the treaties subsisting between
the said courts and one or other of the belligerent powers."</p>

<p>Her Majesty the Empress of Russia conforms herself in
this entirely to the tenth and eleventh articles of her Treaty
of Commerce with Great Britain, and extends also the
engagements of this treaty, which are entirely founded
upon the law of nature, to the Crowns of France and
Spain, which at the date of the present Convention have
no Treaty of Commerce with her empire. His Majesty
the King of Sweden refers himself principally on his part
to the eleventh article of his Treaty of Commerce with
Great Britain, and to the tenor of the preliminary Treaty
of Commerce concluded in the year 1741, between the
Crowns of Sweden and France, although, in this last, the
contents of contraband are not expressly determined, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
as the two Powers have therein understood to consider
one another as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gens amicissima</i>, and that as Sweden has
therein reserved the same advantages, which the Hanseatic
cities enjoy in France, from the most remote times to the
present. The advantages, which are comprehended in
the Treaty of Utrecht, being confirmed, the King has not
found anything necessary to be added. With regard to
Spain, the King finds himself in the same case as the Empress,
and after her example he extends to this Crown the
engagements of the said treaties, wholly founded on natural
law.</p>

<p>Their High Mightinesses, the States-General of the
United Provinces of the Low Countries, have acceded
the 20th of November, 1780, upon the same footing to the
said Convention, and it has been signed the 5th of January,
1781, at St Petersburg, only with the addition of a thirteenth
article, which with relation to command, in case of rencounter
or combination of the squadrons and the vessels of
war of the two parties, there shall be observed what has
been the usage between crowned heads and the Republic.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>This morning the house of Botereau &amp; Co. of this city,
presented to me sixtysix bills of exchange, drawn by Congress
on the 26th day of October last, in favor of Nathaniel
Tracy, of Newburyport, amounting to the sum of ten
thousand pounds sterling, payable at ninety days sight. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
was obliged to ask the favor of the house to wait until I
could write to your Excellency, to see if you can furnish
the funds to discharge the bills. Without your warranty
they must be protested, for I have not yet obtained a single
ducat, nor any certain assurances of one.</p>

<p>I have at length fixed my plan, and when it shall be
made certain that the war with England is to continue,
the prospectus will be published and the experiment tried.
Some persons think I shall get some money; but there is
no certainly of it. If this people should make peace with
England, which they will if they can, we shall get no
money at all. I think, however, that a peace is impossible,
and therefore am not without hopes of borrowing some
money. I must request the honor of your Excellency's
answer by the return of post, because at that time M. Botereau
will expect an answer from me.</p>

<p>The Duc de la Vauguyon is returned. I had the honor
to make my compliments to him on Saturday at the Hague,
where I attended Dr McLane's Church on Sunday, and
the Prince's review upon the parade afterwards, and
where I propose in future to spend more of my time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>You need not be anxious about the result of my demand
of an answer. It was a measure, to which I was advised
by the Duc de la Vauguyon, and by the Count de Vergennes,
and by several worthy gentlemen in the government
here. It was intended to bring necessarily into deliberation
a connexion with France and America, on one
side, at the same time when they considered the mediation
of Russia, on the other, in order to prevent their accepting
the mediation without limitations.</p>

<p>The great city has lately faultered very much in point
of firmness. I cannot but wish, that the proposition for an
accession to the alliance between France and America,
could have been made last week, the critical moment
when it would have infallibly, I think, prevented the acceptation.
But France did not think it politic to do anything
against the views of Russia. But nothing but delay
will come of this mediation. The United States, however,
stand here in a more respectable light than in Spain.
Here they are openly and candidly demanding an answer.
If they receive one in the negative, it will be no more than
the Republic has a right to give, and we shall lose nothing,
but remain exactly where we were. If they give no
answer for a year to come, the dignity of the United States
is safe; that of the United Provinces will be hurt by the
delay, if any. In Spain, the United States have been
waiting in the person of one of their presidents, now going
on three years, and have no answer. Now, I say, it is
better to be open. Here the constitution demanded publicity.
In Spain it forbid it. But the dignity of the
United States is injured more than it would have been, if
the demand to that Court could have been made public.
For my own part, I own, as a private citizen, or as a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
man, I would not advise the United States to wait for
ever, either in Spain or Holland. If it does not suit their
affairs to make a bargain with us, let them tell us so candidly,
and let us all go home, that at least we may not be under
the necessity of calling upon your Excellency for water to
drink, which had much better quench the thirst of our
army.</p>

<p>I should be very much obliged to you for a copy of the
replication of the two Imperial Courts, and of the new proposition
of the Court of London, of which I have only had
a confused intimation.</p>

<h3>TO THE DUC DE LA VAUGUYON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, March 1st, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>As Friesland has taken the Provincial Resolution to
acknowledge the independence of America, it seems to be
high time for me to prepare for the execution of my
instructions from Congress of the 16th of August, which I
had the honor to communicate to you on the 25th of
November, and which had been previously communicated
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs at Versailles.</p>

<p>From these instructions it appears, that His Most Christian
Majesty had made, by his Minister, to Congress, a
tender of his endeavors to accomplish a coalition between
the United Provinces of the Netherlands and the United
States, and that this tender was accepted by Congress as a
fresh proof of his Majesty's solicitude for their interests.</p>

<p>By another Resolution, I am instructed to propose a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
Treaty of Alliance, between His Most Christian Majesty,
the United Provinces of the Netherlands, and the United
States of America, having for its object and limited in its
duration to the present war with Great Britain, and conformed
to the treaties subsisting between His Most Christian
Majesty and the United States.</p>

<p>The system of operations was thus settled at Philadelphia
between the King, by his Minister, and the Congress,
and for obvious and wise reasons, the Minister of Congress
at the Hague was to make the proposition to their High
Mightinesses, and the Ambassador of his Majesty was to
countenance and support it either publicly or privately, as
he should judge proper, until the States-General should
listen to it, so far as to enter into the negotiation.</p>

<p>In pursuance of these propositions, it seems to be
necessary for me to go to the President of their High
Mightinesses, and without offering him anything in writing,
to make him the proposition, in the words of the enclosed
project, or others equivalent.</p>

<p>Friesland has taken so decided a part, and the other
Provinces, especially Holland, are animated with such a
spirit, that I cannot but flatter myself such a proposition
would now run with rapidity through the seven Provinces,
and contribute very much to accelerate the period of this
bloody and ruinous war.</p>

<p>I have the honor to request your Excellency's sentiments
upon the subject, and to be, with the most sincere and
inviolable attachment, your Excellency's most obedient and
most humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Leyden, March 18th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>At length, notwithstanding the mediation of the Empress
of Russia, the States-General have published the following
Manifesto. It is entitled, the Counter Manifesto of the
States-General of the United Provinces of the Low Countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>
<h4>COUNTER MANIFESTO.</h4>

<p>"If ever the annals of the world have furnished an example
of a free and independent State, hostilely attacked
in the manner the most unjust, and without the least appearance
of justice or equity, by a neighboring power, long
in alliance, and strictly connected by ties founded upon
common interests, it is, without contradiction, the Republic
of the United Provinces of the Low Countries, which finds
itself in this case, in relation to his Majesty, the King of
Great Britain, and his Ministry.</p>

<p>"From the commencement of the troubles arisen between
that Kingdom and its Colonies in America, their
High Mightinesses, by no means obliged to take the smallest
part in them, had formed the firm and invariable design
to adopt and to follow in relation to these troubles, the system
of the most perfect and the most exact neutrality;
and when the same troubles had afterwards enkindled a
war, which extended itself to more than one power, and
spread itself to more than one part of the world, their High
Mightinesses have constantly observed and maintained the
same system, while at the same time they have not neglected
to give, on more than one occasion, and relative to
the most essential objects, the most convincing proofs of
their sincere disposition to satisfy the desires of his Majesty,
as far as they could advance, without wounding the rules
of impartiality, and without compromising the rights of their
sovereignty. It was in these views and to this end, that
their High Mightinesses at first, and at the first requisition
of his Britannic Majesty, published prohibitions the most
express against the exportation of military stores to the
Colonies of his Majesty in America, and against all fraudulent
commerce with the same Colonies; and to the end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
that those prohibitions should be executed the more effectually,
their High Mightinesses did not hesitate, moreover,
to take measures which did not fail to restrain and confine
very greatly, the navigation and the commerce of their
own subjects with the Colonies of the State in the West
Indies.</p>

<p>"It was, moreover, in the same views, and to the same
end, that their High Mightinesses sent orders the most precise
to all the Governors and Commanders of their Colonies
and of their establishments, as well as to all the officers,
commanders of their vessels of wars, to take special
care to do nothing towards the flag of the American Congress,
from whence they might lawfully infer or deduce an
acknowledgment of the independence of the said Colonies.
And it was above all in these views and to this end,
that their High Mightinesses having received a memorial,
which was presented to them by the Ambassador of England,
containing complaints the most spirited against the
Governor of St Eustatia, condescended to deliberate concerning
this memorial, although conceived in terms little
accommodated to those respects, which sovereign powers
reciprocally owe to each other.</p>

<p>"This deliberation was soon followed by the recall of
the said Governor, whom their High Mightinesses ordered
to render an account of his conduct, and whom they did
not permit to return to his residence until after he had
exculpated himself of all the accusations brought against
him by a justification of himself in detail, a copy of which
was transmitted without delay to the Ministry of his Britannic
Majesty. It was by means of these measures, that
their High Mightinesses, having always had it at heart to
avoid giving the smallest cause of dissatisfaction to his Britannic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
Majesty, have constantly endeavored to entertain
and to cultivate his friendship and good understanding.
But the conduct of his Britannic Majesty towards the Republic
has been diametrically opposite.</p>

<p>"The troubles between the Courts of London and Versailles
had scarcely broken out, when we saw the ports of
England filled with Dutch ships unjustly taken and detained.
These vessels navigated under the faith of treaties,
and were not loaded with other merchandises than with
those which the express tenor of treaties declared free and
lawful. We saw those free cargoes forced to submit to
the law of an arbitrary and despotic authority. The Cabinet
of St James knowing no other rules than a pretended
right of temporary conveniency, thought proper to appropriate
those cargoes to the Crown by a forced purchase,
and to employ them to the profit of the royal navy. The
representations the most energetic, and the most serious on
the part of their High Mightinesses against such proceedings
were to no purpose, and it was in vain that we demanded
in the strongest manner the treaty of commerce,
which subsisted between England and the Republic; by
this treaty the rights and liberties of the neutral flag were
clearly defined and stated. The subjects of Great Britain
have enjoyed the full advantage of this treaty in the first
and the only case, in which it pleased the Court of London
to remain neuter, while the Republic was at war; at present
in the reciprocal case, this Court cannot without the
greatest injustice refuse the enjoyment of the same advantages
to the Republic; and as little as his Britannic Majesty
had a right to take away the advantageous effects of
this treaty from their High Mightinesses, as little foundation
had he to pretend to turn them from a neutrality, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
they had embraced, and to force them to plunge themselves
into a war, the causes of which had an immediate
relation to rights and to possessions of his Britannic Majesty,
originating without the limits of defensive treaties.</p>

<p>"And, nevertheless, it was this treaty, which his Majesty,
from the commencement of the troubles with the
Crown of France, made no scruple to infringe and violate.
The contraventions and infractions of this treaty on the
part of Great Britain, and the arbitrary decisions of the
courts of justice of that kingdom, directly contrary to the
express sanction of this same treaty, multiplied from day
to day; the merchant vessels of the Republic became the
innocent victims of exactions and accumulated violences of
the English men-of-war and privateers. Not content with
this, even the flag of the State was not spared, but openly
insulted and outraged by the hostile attack of the convoy
under the command of the Rear Admiral, the Count de
Byland. The strongest representations on the part of the
State to his Britannic Majesty were useless. The vessels
taken from this convoy were declared lawful prizes; and
this insult committed to the flag of the Republic was soon
followed by the open violation of its neutral territory, both
in Europe and in America. We shall content ourselves to
cite two examples of it. At the Island of St Martins, the
vessels of his Britannic Majesty attacked and took by
force several vessels, which were in the Road, under the
cannon of the fortress, where, according to the inviolable
law of nations, these vessels ought to have found a safe
asylum. The insolences committed by an English armed
vessel upon the coast of the Republic, near the Island of
Goedereede, furnish a second example of these violences;
these insolences were pushed to such a degree, that several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
inhabitants of the Island, who were upon the shore,
where they ought to have thought themselves sheltered
from all insult, were exposed by the fire of this vessel to
the most imminent danger, which they could not avoid but
by retiring into the interior part of the Island. Unheard
of proceedings, for which the Republic, notwithstanding the
strongest and best founded representations, has not been
able to obtain the smallest satisfaction.</p>

<p>"While affairs were thus in a situation, which left to
their High Mightinesses no other alternative, but to see
the navigation and the commerce of their subjects, upon
which depend the prosperity or the ruin of the Republic,
wholly annihilated, or to come to violent measures against
their ancient friend and ally, the magnanimous heart of her
Majesty, the Empress of Russia, engaged her to invite the
Republic with equal affection and humanity, to take measures
the most just, and entirely conformable to the treaties
which subsist between them and the other powers, to the
end to defend and to maintain, conjointly with her Imperial
Majesty and the other powers of the north, the
privileges and the immunities, which the law of nations
and the most solemn treaties assure to the neutral flag.
This invitation could not but be infinitely agreeable to
their High Mightinesses, considering that it offered them a
means of establishing the protection of the commerce of
their subjects upon the most solid foundation, and opened
a way to place their independence in safety from all infraction,
without derogating in the least from the alliances
contracted, both with his Britannic Majesty and with the
other belligerent powers.</p>

<p>"But it is this same means, which the Court of London
has endeavored to take away from the Republic, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
proceeding with precipitation to extremities the most outrageous,
by the recall of her Ambassador, by the publication
of a Manifesto containing pretended grievances, and by
granting letters of marque and of pretended reprisals
against the State, its subjects, and their goods; by which,
this Court has but too plainly discovered her designs long
since formed, of laying aside the essential interests which
united the two nations, and of breaking the ties of ancient
friendship, by attacking this State by a war the most
unjust.</p>

<p>"It will not be necessary to refute at length the reasons
and pretended griefs alleged in the Manifesto, to convince
every impartial man of their insolidity. It is sufficient
to observe, in a few words, relative to the offer made
by his Britannic Majesty, to open friendly conferences,
that it was the abovementioned Treaty of Marine, which
alone could make the object of those conferences; that the
dispositions of this treaty, conceived in the most expressive
terms, could not be liable to any doubt nor equivocation,
that this treaty gives neutral powers the right of transporting
freely in the ports of the belligerent powers all sorts of
naval stores; that the Republic proposing to itself no other
end, and desiring of his Britannic Majesty no other thing,
than the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the rights stipulated
by this treaty, a point so evidently clear, and so incontestably
just could not become the object of a negotiation,
or of a new convention derogatory to this treaty, so
that their High Mightinesses could not persuade themselves
nor show themselves disposed to renounce, voluntarily,
rights justly acquired, and to desist from these rights from
regard to the Court of England; a renunciation, which,
being advantageous to one of the belligerent powers, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
have been little compatible with the principles of the neutrality,
and by which their High Mightinesses would have
exposed, on the other hand, the safety of the State to
dangers, which they were obliged carefully to avoid; a renunciation,
moreover, which would have caused to commerce
and navigation, the principal support of the Republic,
and source of her prosperity, an irreparable prejudice;
since the different branches of commerce, strictly connected
with each other, form a whole, whereof it is impossible
to cut off so principal a part, without necessarily causing
the destruction and ruin of the whole body; not to mention,
that at the same time that their High Mightinesses
made, with reason, a difficulty to accept the proposed
conferences, they have not a little modified and tempered
the actual exercise of their right by a provisional resolution.</p>

<p>"And as to what relates to the succors demanded, their
High Mightinesses cannot dissemble, that they have never
been able to conceive how his Britannic Majesty has
thought, that he could insist, with the least appearance of
justice or of equity, upon the succors stipulated by the
treaties, at a time when he had already beforehand withdrawn
himself from the obligation, which those treaties
imposed upon him towards the Republic. Their High
Mightinesses have not been less surprised to see, that while
the troubles in America, and their direct consequences
could not concern the Republic in virtue of any treaty,
and that the succor had not been demanded, until after the
Crown of Spain had augmented the number of belligerent
powers, his Britannic Majesty has, nevertheless, taken the
occasion of this event to insist upon his demand with so
much earnestness, and such an ardor, as if his Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
thought himself to have a right to pretend and to maintain,
that a war, once enkindled between him and any other
power, was alone sufficient to oblige the State to grant
forthwith, and without any anterior examination, the succors
stipulated.</p>

<p>"The Republic, it is true, had obliged itself by the
treaties to assist Great Britain at all times, when this kingdom
should find itself attacked, or threatened with an unjust
war; and what is more, the Republic ought in this
case, according to the same treaties, to declare war against
the aggressor; but their High Mightinesses never pretended
to abdicate the right, which flows necessarily from the
nature of every offensive alliance, and which cannot be
contested to allied powers, to examine in the first place,
and before the granting of succors, or taking part in the
war, the principle of the dissensions which have arisen, and
the nature of the difference, which has given occasion to
it, as well as also to examine and weigh thoroughly the
reasons and the motives, which may establish the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus
f&oelig;deris</i>, and which ought to serve as a basis of the justice
and the lawfulness of the war, on the part of that one of
the confederated powers, who demands the succor. And
there exists no treaty, by which their High Mightinesses
have renounced the independence of the State, and sacrificed
their interests to those of Great Britain, to such a
degree, as to deprive themselves of the right of examination,
so necessary and so indispensable, by engaging themselves
to measures, by which they may be considered as
obliged in duty to submit to the good pleasure of the Court
of England, by granting the succors demanded, even
where this Court, engaged in a quarrel with another power,
judges proper to prefer the way of arms to that of a
reasonable satisfaction upon just complaints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>"It was not then by a spirit of party, or by the device
of a predominant cabal, but after a mature deliberation,
and in a sincere desire to maintain the most precious interests
of the Republic, that the States of the respective
Provinces have all unanimously testified, that they were of
opinion, that the succor demanded ought to be refused in
a manner the most polite; and their High Mightinesses
would not have failed to have transmitted to his Britannic
Majesty conformable to these resolutions, an answer to the
repeated demands of succors, if they had not been prevented
by the violent and unheard of attack of the flag of
the State under the command of Rear Admiral Byland,
by the refusal to give satisfaction upon a point so grave,
and by the declaration not less strange than unjust, which
his Majesty thought fit to make relative to the suspension
of the treaties, which subsisted between him and the Republic.
Also many events, which by requiring deliberations
of quite another nature, put an end to those, which
had taken place on the subject of the said requisition.</p>

<p>"It is in vain, and contrary to all truth, that they have
endeavored to multiply the number of grievances, by alleging
the suppression of the duties of exportation as a
measure tending to facilitate the transportation of naval
stores to France; for besides, that this suppression forms
an object, which regards the interior direction of commerce,
to which all the sovereigns have an incontestible
right, and whereof they are not obliged to give an account
to any body, this point has, it is true, been taken into consideration,
but has never been concluded; so that these
rights are still received upon the ancient footing; and that
which is advanced in this regard in the manifesto, is found
destitute of all foundation, although we cannot refrain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
from saying, that the conduct of his Britannic Majesty
towards the Republic, furnished but too many motives to
justify a similar measure on the part of their High Mightinesses.</p>

<p>"The discontent of his Britannic Majesty, on the subject
of what passed with the American, Paul Jones, is also
quite as ill grounded. Already for several years, their
High Mightinesses had resolved, and published everywhere,
precise orders concerning the admission of privateers
and armed vessels of foreign nations with their prizes,
in the ports of their domination, orders, which to that time
had been observed and executed without the least exception.
In the case in question, their High Mightinesses
could not depart from those orders, in regard to an armed
vessel, who, furnished with a commission of the American
Congress, was found in the Road of the Texel, combined
with frigates of war of a sovereign power, without
erecting themselves into judges, and pronouncing a decision
upon matters, in which their High Mightinesses were in nowise
obliged to take any part, and in which it did not appear
to them convenient to the interests of the Republic to
meddle in any manner. Their High Mightinesses then
thought fit not to depart from the orders given so long ago,
but they resolved to give the most express prohibition to
hinder the said armed vessel from providing herself with
warlike stores, and enjoined upon her to quit the Road as
soon as possible, without remaining there longer than the
time absolutely necessary to repair the damages suffered at
sea, with the formal denunciation, that in case of a longer
delay we should be obliged to compel his departure, to
which end the officer of the State, commanding at the said
Road, took care to make the requisite dispositions, whereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
this armed vessel had scarcely the time to prevent the
effects.</p>

<p>"In regard to what has passed in the other parts of the
world, the informations which their High Mightinesses have
received from time to time from the East Indies, are directly
opposite to those, which appear to have come under
the eyes of his Britannic Majesty. The repeated complaints,
which the directors of the East India Company
have addressed to their High Mightinesses, and which the
love of peace has made them stifle in their bosoms, are
incontestible proofs of it. And the measures taken with
regard to the West Indies, enumerated heretofore, ought
to serve in all times as an irrefragable proof of the sincerity,
the zeal, and the attention with which their High
Mightinesses have taken it to heart, to maintain in those
countries the most exact and the most strict neutrality;
and their High Mightinesses have never been able to discover
the smallest legal proof of any infraction of their
orders in this respect.</p>

<p>"As to what concerns the project of an eventual treaty
with North America, conceived by a member of the government
of the Province of Holland, without any public
authority, and the memorials presented upon this subject
by Sir Joseph Yorke, the affair happened in the following
manner. As soon as the Ambassador had presented the
memorial of the 10th of November of the last year, their
High Mightinesses, without stopping at expressions little
suitable among sovereigns, with which this memorial was
filled, did not delay to commence a deliberation the most
serious upon this subject, and it was by their resolution of
the 27th of the same month, that they did not hesitate to
<em>disavow</em> and to <em>disapprove</em> publicly all which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
done in this respect; after which, they had all reason to
expect that his Britannic Majesty would have acquiesced
in this declaration, since he could not be ignorant that their
High Mightinesses exercise no jurisdiction in the respective
Provinces, and that it was to the States of the Province
of Holland to whom, as clothed like the States of
the other Provinces, with a sovereign and exclusive authority
over their subjects, ought to be remitted an affair
relatively to which their High Mightinesses had no reason
to doubt, that the States of the said Province would act
according to the exigence of the case, and conformably to
the laws of the State and the rules of equity.</p>

<p>"The earnestness with which Sir Joseph Yorke insisted,
by a second memorial, upon the article of the punishment,
cannot therefore but appear very strange to their High
Mightinesses, and their surprise increased still more when
three days afterwards, this Ambassador declared, verbally,
to the President of their High Mightinesses, that if he did
not receive that day an answer entirely satisfactory to his
memorial, he should be obliged to inform his Court of it by
an express; their High Mightinesses, informed of this declaration,
penetrated the importance of it, as manifesting visibly
the measure already resolved in the Council of the
King; and although the established customs admit not of
deliberations upon verbal declarations of foreign Ministers,
they judged it nevertheless proper to depart from them on
this occasion, and to order their Secretary to wait on Sir
Joseph Yorke, and give him to understand that his memorial
had been taken <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad referendum</i> by the Deputies of the
respective Provinces conformably to received usages, and
to the constitution of the government; adding, what appears
to have been omitted with design in the manifesto, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
they would endeavor to complete an answer to his memorial
as soon as possible, and as soon as the constitution of
the government would permit. Accordingly, a few days
after, the Deputies of Holland notified to the assembly of
their High Mightinesses, that the States of their Province
had unanimously resolved to require the advice of their
Court of Justice, on the subject of demand of punishment,
charging the said Court to give their opinion the soonest
possible, laying aside all other affairs. Their High Mightinesses
did not fail to transmit forthwith this resolution to
Sir Joseph Yorke; but what was their surprise and their
astonishment, when they learned that this Ambassador,
after having reviewed his instructions, had addressed a billet
to the Secretary, by which, in accusing this resolution
with being evasive, he refused to transmit it to his Court;
which obliged their High Mightinesses to send the said
resolution to the Count de Welderen, their Minister at
London, with orders to present it as soon as possible to the
Ministry of his Britannic Majesty; but the refusal of this
Ministry threw an obstacle in the way of the execution of
these orders.</p>

<p>"After this explanation of all the circumstances of this
affair, the impartial public will be in a condition to set a
just value upon the principal motive, or rather pretext
which his Britannic Majesty has used to let loose the reins
of his designs against the Republic. The affair reduces
itself to this. His Majesty was informed of a negotiation
which should have taken place in the year 1778, between
a member of the government of one of the Provinces and
a representative of the American Congress, which negotiation
would have had for its object to project a treaty of
commerce, to be concluded between the Republic and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
said Colonies, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casu quo</i>, viz. in case the independence of
these Colonies should have been acknowledged by the
Crown of England; this negotiation, although conditional,
and annexed to a condition, which depended upon an act
to be antecedently performed by his Majesty himself; this
negotiation, which without this act, or this anterior declaration,
could not produce the smallest effect, was taken in so
ill a part by his Majesty, and appeared to excite his discontent
in such a degree, that he thought fit to require of
the State a disavowal and a public disapprobation, as well
as a complete punishment and satisfaction. It was forthwith,
and without the least delay, that their High Mightinesses
granted the first part of the requisition, but the
punishment demanded was not in their power, and they
could not agree to it, without flying in the face of the fundamental
constitution of the State. The States of the
Province of Holland were the only tribunal to which it belonged
to take legal cognizance, and to provide for the case
by the ordinary and regular ways.</p>

<p>"This Sovereign, constantly attached to the maxims,
which obliged it to respect the authority of the laws, and
fully convinced that the maintenance of the department of
justice in all the integrity and impartiality which are inseparable
from it, ought to form one of the firmest supports of
the supreme Power; this Sovereign, constrained by everything
which is most sacred to defend, and to protect the
rights and the privileges of its subjects, could not forget
itself to such a degree as to subscribe to the will of his
Britannic Majesty, by giving a blow to these rights and
privileges, and by overleaping the bounds prescribed by
the fundamental laws of the government. These laws required
the intervention of the judiciary department, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
this was accordingly the means which the said States resolved
to employ, by requiring upon this object the advice
of the Court of Justice established in their Province. It is
by following this course that they have displayed before
the eyes of his Britannic Majesty, of the English nation,
and of all Europe, the unalterable principles of justice and
equity, which characterise the Batavian Constitution, and
which in a part so important of the public administration
as is that which regards the exercise of the judiciary
power, ought forever to serve as a buckler and a rampart
against everything which could hurt the safety and the
independence of a free nation; it was also by this means,
and by following this course, that very far from shutting
the road of justice, or evading the demand of punishment,
they have on the contrary, left a free course to the way of
regular proceeding, and conformable to the constitutional
principles of the Republic; and it is finally by the same
means, that by taking away from the Court of London all
pretence of being able to complain of a denial of justice,
they have prevented even to the smallest shadow or appearance
of reason, which could authorise this Court to use
reprisals to which, nevertheless, it has made no scruple to
recur in a manner equally odious and unjust.</p>

<p>"But while the State took measures so just and so
proper to remove all subject of complaint, the measure
which was the epoch of the commencement of the rupture
had already been resolved and concluded in the Council
of the King. This Council had resolved to try all sorts of
means to traverse and hinder, if it had been possible, the
accession of the Republic to the convention of the Powers
of the North, and the event has clearly demonstrated, that
it is in hatred and resentment of this convention that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
said Court has suffered itself to be drawn into the part,
which it has been pleased to take against the Republic.
For these causes, and since that after the repeated outrages
and immense losses, which the subjects of the Republic
must have sustained on the part of his Majesty, the King of
Great Britain, their High Mightinesses find themselves
moreover provoked and attacked by his said Majesty, and
forced to employ the means which they have in hand, to
defend and avenge the precious rights of their liberty and
independence, they assure themselves with the firmest
confidence, that the God of armies, the God of their
fathers, who by the visible direction of his Providence
sustained and delivered their Republic in the midst of the
greatest dangers, will bless the means, which they have
resolved to put in operation for their lawful defence, in
crowning the justice of their arms, by the succors always
triumphant of his Almighty protection, while that their
High Mightinesses will desire with ardor the moment,
when they shall see their neighbor and their ally, now their
enemy, brought back to moderate and equitable sentiments;
and at this epoch, their High Mightinesses will
seize with earnestness all events, which, compatible with
the honor and independence of a free State, may tend to
reconcile them with their ancient friend and ally.</p>

<p>"Thus done and resolved at the Assembly of their High
Mightinesses, the Lords the States-General of the United
Provinces of the Low Countries, at the Hague, the 12th
of March, 1781."</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that their High Mightinesses, after so
many delays, have chosen for the publication of this Manifesto,
a time when the mediation of the Empress is depending.
This mediation appears in a memorial, presented
the 1st of March to the States-General, in these words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>"High and Mighty Lords.&mdash;As soon as her Majesty, the
Empress, was informed of the sudden departure from the
Hague of the Ambassador of his Britannic Majesty to your
High Mightinesses, guided by the sentiments of friendship
and benevolence, which she professes towards the two
powers, she did not wait for further explanations, concerning
the consequences, which might be produced by a procedure
so alarming for their reciprocal tranquillity and
well-being, to make by her Minister at the Court of London
representations the most pressing, to the end to divert it, if
it were possible, from coming to violent measures, and to
induce it rather to prefer those of softness and conciliation,
offering herself to co-operate in everything which might
depend upon her. Although her Majesty has not yet had
the time to receive the answer of the Court of London,
she has, nevertheless, reason to presume, that her insinuations
there will be received with pleasure.</p>

<p>In this confidence, the Empress does not hesitate to
give a new proof of her salutary intentions in favor of the
reunion of two States, for whom she has an equal affection,
and whom she has seen for so long a time live together in
an intelligence the most perfect, and the most natural to
their respective interests, by proposing to them formally
her good offices and her mediation, to interrupt and put an
entire end to the discord and the war, which has broken
out between them. While M. Simolin, the Minister of
the Empress at the Court of London, acquits himself of
the orders, which she has given him concerning this object,
the undersigned has the honor to fulfil the same task, on
his part, towards your High Mightinesses, and to assure
you of the zeal and earnestness with which he should
desire to labor at the precious work of the re-establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
of the repose and the tranquillity of your State. The disinterestedness,
the impartiality, and the views of general
beneficence, which have instamped their seal upon all the
actions of her Imperial Majesty, preside equally in this.
The wisdom and the prudence of your High Mightinesses
will know how to acknowledge in her these august characters,
and will dictate the answer, which the subscriber will
have to transmit to her, concerning the execution of his
orders.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Leyden, March 19th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received your Excellency's letter of the 1st of
January, with the commission and instructions enclosed.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
I am very sensible of this fresh instance of the confidence
of Congress, and shall do everything in my power to discharge
the duties of this new trust; but I am obliged to
say, that no commission that ever was given, required more
patience, fortitude, and circumspection than this, virtues
which I much fear have not fallen in sufficient quantities
to my share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
I have experienced since my residence in this Republic,
a great change in the external behavior of several persons
of rank, who upon my first arrival received me with distinction,
but from the moment of the publication of the
papers taken with Mr Laurens, have been afraid to see
me. The nation has indeed been in a violent fermentation
and crisis. It is divided in sentiments. There are Stadtholderians
and Republicans; there are proprietors in English
funds, and persons immediately engaged in commerce;
there are enthusiasts for peace and alliance with England;
and there are advocates for an alliance with France, Spain,
and America; and there is a third sort who are for adhering
in all things to Russia, Sweden, and Denmark; some
are for acknowledging American independence, and entering
into treaties of commerce and alliance with her; others
start at the idea with horror, as an everlasting impediment
to a return to the friendship and alliance with England;
some will not augment the navy without increasing the
army; others will let the navy be neglected rather than
augment the army.</p>

<p>In this perfect chaos of sentiments and systems, principles
and interests, it is no wonder there is languor, a weakness
and irresolution, that is vastly dangerous in the present
circumstances of affairs. The danger lies not more in the
hostile designs and exertions of the English, than in the
prospect of seditions and commotions among the people,
which are every day dreaded and expected. If it were
not for a standing army, and troops posted about in several
cities, it is probable there would have been popular tumults
before now; but everybody that I see, appears to me to
live in constant fear of mobs, and in a great degree of uncertainty
whether they will rise in favor of war or against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
it; in favor of England or against it; in favor of the Prince
or of the city of Amsterdam; in favor of America or
against it. I have ventured in the midst of these critical
circumstances, pressed as I am to get money to discharge
the bills of exchange, which Congress have drawn and I
have accepted, to open a loan; but this is looked upon as
a very hardy and dangerous measure, which nobody but
an American would have risked, and I am obliged to assure
Congress, that people are as yet so much afraid of being
pointed out by the mob or the soldiery, as favorers of this
loan, that I have no hopes at all of succeeding for several
months, if ever.</p>

<p>I have been advised to do nothing, in consequence of my
commission, to the States at present, for fear of throwing
before the people new objects of division and dissension. I
have, however, communicated to their High Mightinesses,
and to the Ministers of Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and
France, the resolution of Congress, of the 5th of October,
relative to the principles of the neutral confederation. The
memorial and letters I have transmitted to Congress.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Whenever I shall communicate to their High Mightinesses
the full powers of Congress, the course will be this.
They will lie long upon the table, then taken <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad referendum</i>,
that is, sent to the several Provinces, cities, and
bodies of nobles, who compose the sovereignty, or as some
say, the deputies of the sovereignty; these will deliberate,
and deliberate, and deliberate, and probably some will be
for, and some against making a treaty, at least it is supposed
that Zealand and one or two other Provinces will
be against it. But in the meantime, there will be much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
communication and negotiation among individuals at least,
between this country and Russia, Sweden and Denmark
upon the subject; and if it is true, as I am informed in
a letter from Mr Gerry, that a Minister is appointed to
the Court of Petersburg, as I hope it is, and that the same
Minister, or some other, is empowered to treat with Sweden
and Denmark, it is not impossible, I think it indeed
probable, that we may succeed with these four nations at
once; for let me add, there is not in my apprehension the
least prospect of a general peace. England is at her old
game of seduction and division, and is laboring under the
pretence of employing the Emperor of Germany and the
Empress of Russia in mediations for peace, insidiously to
embroil all Europe in the war.</p>

<p>From motives of philanthropy, I hope she will not succeed,
unless the same feelings of humanity should prompt
me to wish all mankind at war with that nation, for her
humiliation, which is at this time, if ever one was, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hostis
humani generis</i>.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Leyden, March 29th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The Baron de Lynden, Envoy Extraordinary from their
High Mightinesses at the Court of Stockholm, had, about
the 28th of February, a conference with the Count Ulrich
Scheffer, to whom he presented, on the part of his masters,
a Memorial too important to be omitted. It is as
follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>"The subscriber, Minister Extraordinary of their High
Mightinesses, the States-General of the United Provinces,
to his Majesty, the King of Sweden, by express orders
received from his masters, has the honor to propose to his
Majesty,</p>

<p>"That their High Mightinesses, by their resolution of
the 20th of November, having acceded to the confederation
of the armed neutrality, according to the invitation
given by the powers of the North, placing the most perfect
confidence in the power, the magnanimity, and the fidelity
of their Imperial and Royal Majesties, for fulfilling their
engagements, and maintaining their dignity, by completing
a work so gloriously undertaken, to wit, the liberty of the
seas for neutral nations, did not suffer themselves to be
diverted by the consideration of the consequences, which
this accession and this declaration might draw upon the
Republic from the part of the belligerent powers; but their
High Mightinesses declared themselves for this accession
and this declaration, relying, without reserve, upon the
sentiments of their Imperial and Royal Majesties, which
they manifested in the season, by the steps taken in this
respect.</p>

<p>"That the event has entirely justified the instances of
their High Mightinesses in regard to the British Court,
since its Minister, after several vain attempts tending to
impede the accession to the alliance in question, resolved,
from the time when he had the first intimation of it, to
speak a language altogether unheard of, and such as is
scarcely agreeable to those respects, which sovereigns respectively
owe each other, without allowing to the Republic
the time necessary to take the affair into deliberation,
conformably to a political system, which his Britannic Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
fully understands; the Minister, nevertheless, insisting
on a prompt and immediate satisfaction, and the punishment
of a pretended offence, occasioned by the discovery
of a negotiation with North America, without being
satisfied by the provisional answer, or by the formal disavowal
of their High Mightinesses touching the said negotiation,
in which, as his Britannic Majesty has acknowledged,
they had in nowise participated, nor had any knowledge
of it; a negotiation relative to a pretended treaty, which,
at the first glance of the eye, indicates sufficiently by its
proper terms, to be nothing more than a project of an
eventual treaty made by certain individuals, without being
formally authorised thereto by the magistrates of Amsterdam,
as a body, nor by the States of the Provinces of
Holland, and still less by the States-General, who alone
are authorised to contract engagements in the name of the
Republic. The Minister in question refused even to accept
the resolution, which enjoined on the Court of Holland,
(the Province, which alone this affair concerns,) to
deliberate, whether the laws of the country could authorise
to pursue in justice the persons accused, and to punish
them? A formality, without which no punishment can be
inflicted, either in England, in this Republic, or in any
other country. This Minister added menaces, that his
Sovereign would procure for himself the satisfaction demanded;
he was, at the same time, determined to attack
the Republic by surprise, and to precipitate so violently the
measures taken to commence hostilities, that my Lord
Stormont, making use of vain pretences, would not even
accept, on the part of the Count de Welderen, the said
declaration, and answered him in writing, that he could
not consider him any longer as the Minister of a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
power, after having announced to him officially the manifesto
of the King; while the same manifesto, which is remarkable,
was sent to the Count do Welderen one hour
before the time fixed the evening before by Lord Stormont,
after repeated requests to have a conversation with
him.</p>

<p>"Besides, although in the manifesto in question, they
make no mention of the accession of the Republic to the
armed confederacy, (which it was necessary most carefully
to pass over in silence,) it appears, however, distinctly to
the penetrating eye of your Majesty, as well as to that of
all Europe, if they will compare together the whole progress
of this action, the time and the manner, in which
the Manifesto was published, that the hatred occasioned by
the accession of the Republic to the armed neutrality, is
the true motive of the resentment of his Britannic Majesty,
and has prompted him to a manifest aggression against the
Republic, by capturing immediately a great number of
merchant vessels belonging to her subjects, as well as some
vessels of war. Besides, that this same Manifesto, known
to your Majesty, discovers sufficiently the original of this
hatred; considering, that among the pretended causes of
offence serving to justify the hostile measures against the
Republic, they there allege, that she has declared herself
neuter. The Cabinet of St James, disdaining to observe,
that this answer ought to offend the Powers of the North,
to whom the treaties subsisting between England and the
Republic are perfectly known, and that these powers
could not be taxed with concluding a treaty of neutrality
with a power, which they had not judged to be lawfully
neuter in the present war, and without observing, that this
liberty of negotiating has been by England herself put out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
of all doubt, since by her suspension of the treaty of 1674,
made the 17th of April, 1780, she has declared, that she
would hereafter regard the Republic as a neutral power,
not advantaged by any treaty.</p>

<p>"That in virtue of the reasons alleged, the hatred of
Great Britain pierces, still more visibly, through the reproach
inserted in the said Manifesto against the Republic,
that she has advanced and favored the transportation of naval
stores to France, by the suspension of duties upon
those effects; at the same time, that it appears, that this
suspension has never taken place, and that the Republic
has a well founded right to make this transportation, not
only during the continuance of the treaty of 1674, but also
according to the principle prescribed to the neutral powers
by the convention of the confederation; that a further examination
of this manifesto should be superfluous, since
his Majesty may himself estimate its value, and must,
moreover, be convinced, that the conduct of their High
Mightinesses, observed from the commencement of the
troubles in regard to America, has evidently proved, that
they have in nowise favored the revolted Colonies of
America; witness the condescension in favor of England,
to which the Republic was not obliged by the shackles imposed
upon the commerce of her Colonies, by the prohibition
to take under convoy vessels loaded with ship-timber,
and by the recall of the Governor of St Eustatia,
upon the ill founded complaints of the British Ministry;
condescensions, which have been rewarded by the attack
and capture of the convoy sailing under the command of
Count de Byland, by a violation of the territory of the
Republic, and by the capture of American ships under the
cannon of St Martins. That since their High Mightinesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
have faithfully observed this system of moderation, it is
manifest, that the resentment of his Britannic Majesty cannot
be regarded, but as an effect of a resentment occasioned
by the engagement taken for the neutrality, and to
this effect their High Mightinesses are well founded to
claim the tenor and the sense of the articles seventh,
eighth, and ninth of that alliance, which forms the basis of
the union of the neutrality contracted with their Imperial
and Royal Majesties; that thus, there ought not to exist
any further difficulty in fulfilling towards their High Mightinesses,
become allies, the engagements, which are contracted
in virtue of the known convention, of which they
ought to be regarded as members, at the very moment
even when this convention has been formed and concluded
by their High Mightinesses at the Hague, and when their
declaration has been despatched to the belligerent powers,
conformably to the said accession and convention.</p>

<p>"That if their High Mightinesses had occasion to complain
of a single act of offence, or attack committed against
them, and liable to be redressed upon general representations
to their allies, they would have demanded their intervention
for the redress of such a grievance, rather than
to have recourse to arms; but as at present their High
Mightinesses see themselves positively attacked by his
Britannic Majesty, on occasion and in resentment of the
aforesaid alliance, they find themselves obliged to defend
themselves, and to repel the attack in the same manner
in which it has been made, by returning hostilities for hostilities;
being moreover persuaded, that the allied powers
will not make any difficulty to make common cause with
them, to procure to the Republic the satisfaction and indemnification
of the losses sustained, by an attack as unjust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
as it is violent, and that the allies will concur with their
High Mightinesses, in taking such further arrangements as
the present circumstances require. This is what their
High Mightinesses solicit earnestly, expecting it with so
much more confidence, as they are intimately convinced
that the generous and equitable sentiments which animate
their Imperial and Royal Majesties will prevent them from
suffering the Republic to become the victim of a political
system as glorious as it is equitable, conceived for the
maintenance of the safety and the right of neuters, while
the Republic alone exposed to all the violence of this unjust
attack of England, might with difficulty make head
against it, and thereby run the risk of becoming entirely
useless to the confederation.</p>

<p>"For these causes, the undersigned insisted upon the
motives alleged above, fully convinced that the ratifications
of the treaty signed at Petersburg will be made as soon as
possible, and he has the honor, in the name and by the
express order of his masters to demand the accomplishment
of the articles seventh, eighth, and ninth of the said
treaty, and to require in virtue of it a prompt and sufficient
succor of his Majesty, whose equitable and magnanimous
sentiments, known to all Europe, will not permit him to
abandon a work worthy of all praise.</p>

<p>"The friendship and affection of your Majesty towards
their High Mightinesses, appear to assure them beforehand
of the succors which they expect from his Majesty, and to
promise to the subscriber an answer as prompt as satisfactory,
which he ought to press with so much the more zeal,
as every moment of delay occasions great and irreparable
losses to the Republic.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It is of importance to the people of America to observe
how much lighter their own burthens are than those of
their enemies, and for this reason I have every year since
I have been in Europe taken notice of the new taxes laid,
annually, in perpetuity upon the people of Great Britain by
Parliament, in support of tyranny, in addition to all former
debts and taxes. One sixth part of the new taxes of this
year would be more than sufficient to pay the interest of
the whole sum which America will expend this year in
support of liberty. The new taxes consist in an additional
duty of five per cent upon all articles subject to the duty of
excise, except malt, soap, and candles, and green leather,
valued at</p>
<p class="head">£150,000 sterling.</p>

<p>There cannot be a more striking contrast than that between
the conduct of Lord North and M. Necker. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
abilities of the former as a financier consist wholly in laying
new taxes without end; those of the other lie in finding
resources for vast expenses, without laying any new burthens
on the people. M. Necker is laying a foundation
for a credit in France as solid as that of Great Britain, by
stating to the public the expenses and revenues. This is
the only solid foundation of public credit. America will
never obtain a credit of any consequence in Europe until
she has a credit at home. It is demonstrable that the people
of America are able to lend to Congress every year
more than money enough to carry on the war, and pay all
expenses. What is the reason they do not. The reasons
are plain; first, they have not known that their public
money was expended by any fixed rule, so that they could
judge how much it amounted to; secondly, they did not
see any certain prospect of the punctual payment of interest
or principal at a fixed value. All the art of financiering in
America lies in ascertaining with precision by a fixed standard,
how much our expenses are; next ascertaining what
our income is; thirdly, how much must be borrowed;
fourthly, how to assure the payment of interest and principal.</p>

<p>If taxes could be laid by Congress upon exports and
imports, and upon the consumption of articles of luxury,
convenience, and necessity, as they are in Europe, America
would be able to raise more every year in taxes than
she has ever spent in one year. Nay, we might oblige
foreigners to pay all the expenses of the war, and establish
a credit much more solid than that of Great Britain, because
we have not such a debt to begin with. But without
recurring to this system, which might injure our commerce
as well as our liberties, it is unquestionably owing entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
to regulations of prices, embargoes, and stamping an arbitrary
value upon what had no value, that has hitherto
ruined our credit. But when all these systems shall be
totally abolished in the several States, and measures shall
be taken to lay annual taxes of a certain value, and these
taxes mortgaged for the payment of interest, there is not
a doubt but every State may obtain credit enough for the
necessities of its own inhabitants.</p>

<h3>MEMORIAL TO THE STATES-GENERAL.</h3>

<p>To their High Mightinesses, the States-General of the
United Provinces of the Low Countries.</p>

<p class="open">
High and Mighty Lords,
</p>

<p>The subscriber has the honor to propose to your High
Mightinesses, that the United States of America in Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
assembled, have lately thought fit to send him a
commission (with full powers and instructions) to confer
with your High Mightinesses, concerning a treaty of amity
and commerce; an authentic copy of which he has the
honor to annex to this memorial.</p>

<p>At the time, when the treaties between this Republic
and the Crown of Great Britain were made, the people
who now compose the United States of America, were a
part of the English nation; as such, allies of the Republic
and parties to those treaties; entitled to all their benefits,
and submitting cheerfully to all their obligations.</p>

<p>It is true, that when the British administration, renouncing
the ancient character of Englishmen, for generosity, justice,
and humanity, conceived the design of subverting the political
systems of the Colonies; depriving them of the rights
and liberties of Englishmen, and reducing them to the
worst of all forms of government; starving the people by
blockading the ports, and cutting off their fisheries and
commerce; sending fleets and armies to destroy every
principle and sentiment of liberty, and to consume their
habitations and their lives; making contracts for foreign
troops and alliances with savage nations, to assist them in
their enterprize; casting formally, by act of Parliament,
three millions of people at once out of the protection of the
Crown; then, and not till then, did the United States of
America, in Congress assembled, pass that memorable act,
by which they assumed an equal station among the nations.</p>

<p>This immortal Declaration, of the 4th of July, 1776,
when America was invaded by a hundred vessels of war,
and, according to estimates laid before Parliament, by fiftyfive
thousand of veteran troops, was not the effect of any
sudden passion, or enthusiasm; but a measure which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
been long in deliberation among the people, maturely
discussed in some hundreds of popular assemblies and
by public writings in all the States; it was a measure
which Congress did not adopt, until they had received
the positive instructions of their constituents in all the States;
it was then unanimously adopted by Congress, subscribed
by all its members, transmitted to the Assemblies of the
several States, and by them respectively accepted, ratified,
and recorded among their archives; so that no
decree, edict, statute, placard or fundamental law of any
nation was ever made with more solemnity, or with more
unanimity or cordiality adopted, as the act and consent of
the whole people, than this; and it has been held sacred
to this day by every State with such unshaken firmness,
that not even the smallest has ever been induced to depart
from it; although the English have wasted many millions,
and vast fleets and armies, in the vain attempt to invalidate
it. On the contrary, each of the thirteen States
instituted a form of government for itself, under the
authority of the people; has erected its legislature in the
several branches; its executive authority with all its offices;
its judiciary departments and judges; its army, militia,
revenue, and some of them their navy; and all these
departments of government have been regularly and constitutionally
organised under the associated superintendency
of Congress now these five years, and have acquired
a consistency, solidity, and activity, equal to the oldest
and most established governments.</p>

<p>It is true, that in some speeches and writings of the
English, it is still contended, that the people of America
are still in principle and affection with them; but these
assertions are made against such evident truth and demonstration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
that it is surprising they should find at this day one
believer in the world. One may appeal to the writings
and recorded speeches of the English for the last seventeen
years, to show that similar misrepresentations have
been incessantly repeated through that whole period, and
that the conclusion of every year has in fact confuted the
confident assertions and predictions of the beginning of it.
The subscriber begs leave to say from his own knowledge
of the people of America, (and he has a better right to obtain
credit, because he has better opportunities to know,
than any Briton whatsoever,) that they are unalterably determined
to maintain their independence. He confesses,
that, notwithstanding his confidence through his whole life,
in the virtuous sentiments and uniformity of character
among his countrymen, their unanimity has surprised him;
that all the power, arts, intrigues and bribes, which have
been employed in the several States, should have seduced
from the standard of virtue so contemptible a few, is more
fortunate than could have been expected.</p>

<p>This independence stands upon so broad and firm a
bottom of the people's interests, honor, consciences, and
affections, that it will not be affected by any successes that
the English may obtain, either in America or against the
European powers at war, or by any alliances they can
possibly form, if indeed in so unjust and desperate a cause
they can obtain any. Nevertheless, although compelled
by necessity, and warranted by the fundamental laws of the
Colonies and of the British constitution; by principles
avowed in the English laws, and confirmed by many examples
in the English history; by principles interwoven into
the history and public right of Europe, in the great examples
of the Helvetic and Batavian confederacies and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
others, and frequently acknowledged and ratified by the
diplomatic body; principles founded in eternal justice and
the laws of God and nature; to cut asunder forever all the
ties which had connected them with Great Britain; yet the
people of America did not consider themselves as separating
from their allies, especially the Republic of the United
Provinces, or departing from their connexions with any of
the people under their government; but, on the contrary,
they preserved the same affection, esteem, and respect for
the Dutch nation in every part of the world, which they
and their ancestors had ever entertained.</p>

<p>When sound policy dictated to Congress the precaution
of sending persons to negotiate natural alliances in Europe,
it was not from a failure in respect that they did not send a
Minister to your High Mightinesses with the first whom
they sent abroad; but instructed in the nature of the connexions
between Great Britain and the Republic, and in
the system of peace and neutrality, which she had so long
pursued, they thought proper to respect both so far, as not
to seek to embroil her with her allies, to excite divisions in
the nation or lay embarrassments before it. But since the
British administration, uniform and persevering in injustice,
despising their allies, as much as their colonists and fellow-subjects;
disregarding the faith of treaties, as much as that
of royal charters; violating the law of nations, as they
had before done the fundamental laws of the Colonies and
the inherent rights of British subjects; have arbitrarily set
aside all the treaties between the Crown and the Republic,
declared war and commenced hostilities, the settled intentions
of which they had manifested long before, all those
motives, which before restrained the Congress, cease, and
an opportunity presents of proposing such connexions as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
the United States of America have a right to form, consistent
with those already formed with France and Spain,
which they are under every obligation of duty, interest, and
inclination to observe sacred and inviolate, and consistent
with such other treaties as it is their intention to propose to
other sovereigns.</p>

<p>A natural alliance may be formed between the two Republics,
if ever one existed among nations. The first
planters of the four northern States, found in this country
an asylum from persecution, and resided here from the
year 1608 to the year 1620, twelve years preceding their
migration. They have ever entertained, and have transmitted
to posterity, a grateful remembrance of that protection
and hospitality, and especially of that religious liberty
they found here, though they had sought them in vain in
England.</p>

<p>The first inhabitants of two other States, New York and
New Jersey, were immediate emigrants from this nation,
and have transmitted their religion, language, customs,
manners, and character; and America in general, until her
relations were formed with the House of Bourbon, has
ever considered this nation as her first friend in Europe,
whose history and the great characters it exhibits in the
various arts of peace, as well as achievements in war by
sea and land, have been particularly studied, admired, and
imitated in every State.</p>

<p>A similitude of religion, although it is not deemed so
essential in this as it has been in former ages to the alliance
of nations, is still, as it ever will be thought, a desirable
circumstance. Now it may be said with truth, that there
are no two nations whose worship, doctrine, and discipline,
are more alike, than those of the two Republics. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
particular, therefore, as far as it is of weight, an alliance
would be perfectly natural.</p>

<p>A similarity in the forms of government is usually considered
as another circumstance, which renders alliances
natural; and although the constitutions of the two Republics
are not perfectly alike, there is yet analogy enough
between them to make a connexion easy in this respect.</p>

<p>In general usages, and in the liberality of sentiments in
those momentous points, the freedom of inquiry, the right
of private judgment, and the liberty of conscience, of so
much importance to be supported in the world, and imparted
to all mankind, and which at this hour are in more
danger from Great Britain, and that intolerant spirit, which
is secretly fermenting there, than from any other quarter,
the two nations resemble each other more than any other.</p>

<p>The originals of the two Republics are so much alike,
that the history of one seems but a transcript from that of
the other; so that every Dutchman instructed in the subject
must pronounce the American revolution just and necessary,
or pass a censure upon the greatest actions of his
immortal ancestors; actions which have been approved
and applauded by mankind, and justified by the decision
of Heaven.</p>

<p>But the circumstance, which, perhaps in this age, has
stronger influence than any other in the formation of friendships
between nations, is the great and growing interest of
commerce, of the whole system of which through the globe,
your High Mightinesses are too perfect masters for me
to say anything, that is not familiarly known. It may not,
however, be amiss to hint, that the central situation of this
country, her extensive navigation, her possessions in the
East and West Indies, the intelligence of her merchants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
the number of her capitalists, and the riches of her funds,
render a connexion with her desirable to America. And
on the other hand, the abundance and variety of the productions
of America, the materials of manufactures, navigation,
and commerce, the vast demand and consumption
of the manufactures of Europe, of the merchandises from
the Baltic, and from the East Indies, and the situation of
the Dutch possessions in the West Indies, cannot admit of
a doubt, that a connexion with the United States would be
useful to this Republic. The English are so sensible of
this, that, notwithstanding all their professions of friendship,
they have ever considered this nation as their rival in the
American trade; a sentiment which dictated and maintained
their severe act of navigation, as injurious to the
commerce and naval power of this country, as it was both
to the trade and the rights of the Colonies. There is now
an opportunity offered to both to shake off this shackle
for ever. If any consideration whatever could have prevailed
with the English to have avoided a war with your
High Mightinesses, it would have been an apprehension of
an alliance between the two Republics; and it is easy to
foresee, that nothing will contribute more to oblige them to
a peace than such a connexion once completely formed.</p>

<p>It is needless to point out particularly what advantages
might be derived to the possessions of the Republic in the
West Indies, from a trade opened, protected, and encouraged
between them and the Continent of America, or what
profits might be made by the East India Company, by
carrying their effects directly to the American market;
how much even the trade of the Baltic might be secured
and extended by a free intercourse with America, which
has ever had so large a demand, and will have more, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
hemp, cordage, sailcloth, and other articles of that commerce;
how much the national navigation would be benefitted,
by building and purchasing ships there; how much
the number of seamen might be increased, or how much
advantage to both countries to have their ports mutually
opened to their men-of-war and privateers, and their
prizes.</p>

<p>If, therefore, analogy of religion, government, original
manners, and the most extensive and lasting commercial
interests, can form a ground and an invitation to political
connexions, the subscriber flatters himself, that in all these
particulars the union is so obviously natural, that there has
seldom been a more distinct designation of Providence
to any two distant nations to unite themselves together.</p>

<p>It is further submitted to the wisdom and humanity of
your High Mightinesses, whether it is not visibly for the
good of mankind, that the powers of Europe, who are
convinced of the justice of the American cause, (and
where is one to be found that is not) should make haste to
acknowledge the independence of the United States, and
form equitable treaties with them, as the surest means of
convincing Great Britain of the impracticability of her
pursuits? Whether the late Marine Treaty, concerning
the rights of neutral vessels, noble and useful as it is, can
be established against Great Britain, who never will adopt
it nor submit to it, but from necessity, without the independence
of America? Whether the return of America,
with her nurseries of seamen, and magazines of materials
for navigation and commerce, to the domination
and monopoly of Great Britain, if that were practicable,
would not put the possessions of other nations beyond seas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
wholly in the power of that enormous Empire, which has
long been governed wholly by the feeling of its own power;
at least without a proportional attention to justice, humanity,
or decency? When it is obvious and certain, that
the Americans are not inclined to submit again to the
British government, on one hand; and that the powers of
Europe ought not, and could not, with safety consent to
it, if they were, on the other; why should a source of
contention be left open for future contingencies to involve
the nations of Europe in still more bloodshed, when, by
one decisive step of the maritime powers, in making
treaties with a nation long in possession of sovereignty, by
right and in fact, it might be closed?</p>

<p>The example of your High Mightinesses would, it is
hoped, be followed by all the maritime powers, especially
those, which are parties to the late Marine Treaty; nor can
an apprehension, that the independence of America would
be injurious to the trade of the Baltic, be any objection.
This jealousy is so groundless, that the reverse would happen.
The freight and ensurance in voyages across the
Atlantic are so high, and the price of labor in America so
dear, that tar, pitch, turpentine, and ship-timber can never
be transported to Europe at so cheap a rate as it has
been and will be afforded by countries round the Baltic.
This commerce was supported by the English before the
revolution with difficulty, and not without large Parliamentary
bounties. Of hemp, cordage, and sailcloth, there will
not probably be a sufficiency raised in America for her
own consumption in many centuries, for the plainest of all
reasons, because these articles can be imported from Amsterdam,
or even from Petersburg, or Archangel, cheaper
than they can be raised at home. America will therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
be for ages a market for most of these articles of the Baltic
trade.</p>

<p>Nor is there more, solidity in another supposition, propagated
by the English to prevent other nations from pursuing
their true interests, that other colonies will follow the
example of the United States. Those powers, which have
as large possessions as any beyond seas, have already declared
against England, apprehending no such consequences.
Indeed there is no probability of any other power
of Europe following the example of England, in attempting
to change the whole system of the government of colonies,
and reducing them by oppression to the necessity of
governing themselves. And without such manifest injustice
and cruelty on the part of the metropolis, there is no
danger of colonies attempting innovations. Established
governments are founded deeply in the hearts, the passions,
the imaginations, and understandings of the people,
and without some violent change from without, to alter the
temper and character of the whole people, it is not in
human nature to exchange safety for danger, and certain
happiness for very precarious benefits.</p>

<p>It is submitted to the consideration of your High Mightinesses,
whether the system of the United States, which
was minutely considered and discussed, and unanimously
agreed on in Congress in the year 1776, in planning the
treaty they proposed to France, to form equitable commercial
treaties with all the maritime powers of Europe,
without being governed or monopolised by any; a system
which was afterwards approved by the King, and made the
foundation of the treaties with his Majesty, a system to
which the United States have hitherto constantly adhered,
and from which they never will depart, unless compelled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
some powers declaring against them, which is not expected;
is not the only means of preventing this growing
country from being an object of everlasting jealousies, rivalries,
and wars among the nations? If this idea is just, it
follows, that it is the interest of every State in Europe to
acknowledge American independence immediately. If
such benevolent policy should be adopted, the new world
will be a proportional blessing to every part of the old.</p>

<p>The subscriber has the further honor of informing your
High Mightinesses, that the United States of America, in
Congress assembled, impressed with a high sense of the
wisdom and magnanimity of your High Mightinesses, and
of your inviolable attachment to the rights and liberties of

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, April 27th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received your Excellency's letter of the 21st, and
will send you the list of the bills, and of the times of their
becoming due, according to your desire, as soon as I can
make it out. I will examine M. de Neufville's bill, and if
it is good accept it.</p>

<p>From the time I received from Congress their orders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
borrow money here, I have constantly in my letters requested
that no drafts might be made upon me, until there
was news from me, that I had money to discharge them,
and this request I shall repeat. But the cry of the army
for clothes, induces Congress to venture upon measures,
which appear hazardous to us. However, by the intelligence
I have, they had grounds to expect that the drafts
hitherto made would be honored.</p>

<p>I sometimes think, however, paradoxical as it may seem,
that one set of bills protested, would immediately procure
Congress a large loan. No bills are in better credit than
these. There is an appetite here for American trade, as
ravenous as that of a shark for his prey; and if they saw a
prospect of having their trade broken up, they would do
much to save it.</p>

<p>I have the honor to acquaint your Excellency, that I
some time ago received from Congress, full powers to conclude
with the States-General of the United Provinces of
the Low Countries, concerning a Treaty of Amity and
Commerce; and that I have very lately received a letter
of credence, as Minister Plenipotentiary to their High
Mightinesses, and another to his Most Serene Highness,
the Prince of Orange. Being thus fixed to this country
for the present, I have taken a house in Amsterdam, on
the Keizersgragt, near the Spiegel street, for the convenience
of our countrymen, who have occasion to visit me,
and of the merchants, who have bills upon me, until their
High Mightinesses shall have taken the necessary time to
deliberate upon it, and determine to acknowledge the independence
of the United States, enter into a treaty with
them, and receive me at the Hague. If this should happen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
I hope we shall obtain a credit here; but we never
shall before.</p>

AT THE HAGUE.</h3>

Leyden, May 1st, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>By the tenth article of the Treaty of Alliance between
France and America, the Most Christian King and the United
States agree, to invite or admit other powers, who may
receive injuries from England, to make common cause with
them, and to accede to that alliance, under such conditions
as shall be freely agreed to, and settled between all the
parties.</p>

<p>It will be readily acknowledged, that this Republic has
received injuries from England; and it is not improbable,
that several other maritime powers may be soon, if they
are not already, in the same predicament. But, whether
his Majesty will think fit to invite this nation at present to
accede to that alliance, according to the article, must be
submitted to his wisdom.</p>

<p>It is only proper for me to say, that whenever your Excellency
shall have received his Majesty's commands, and
shall judge it proper to take any measures, either for admitting
or inviting this Republic to accede, I shall be ready,
in behalf of the United States, to do whatever is necessary
and proper for them to do upon the occasion.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Leyden, May 3d, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 1st of May I went to the Hague, and wrote to
his Excellency, Peter Van Bleiswick, Grand Pensionary
of Holland, that having something of importance to communicate
to him, I proposed to do myself the honor to
wait on him the next morning at half past eight, if that
time should be agreeable to him; but if any other hour
was more convenient, I requested his Excellency to mention
it. The answer, which was not in writing, was, that
half past eight should be the time.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next morning I waited on him, and
was politely received. I informed him that I had asked
his permission to make him this visit, in order to inform
him, that I had received from my Sovereign, the United
States of America, full powers to treat with the States-General,
and a letter of credence, as a Minister Plenipotentiary
to their High Mightinesses, and another to his
Most Serene Highness, the Prince; and that it was my
intention to communicate those powers and letters to their
High Mightinesses, and to his Most Serene Highness on
Friday next, the 4th of May.</p>

<p>His Excellency said he would acquaint the States-General
and his Highness with it; that, in his private opinion,
he thought favorably of it, but that he must wait the
orders of his masters; that it was a matter somewhat delicate
for the Republic. I replied, as to the delicacy of it
in the present state of open war between England and Holland,
I hoped that it would not be any obstacle; that I
thought it the interest of the Republic, as well as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
America. His Excellency rejoined, "one thing is certain,
we have a common enemy."</p>

<p>As this was a visit simply to impart my design, and as I
knew enough of the delicate situation, and of the reputed
sentiments of this officer, to be sensible that he did not
wish to enter into any very particular conversation at this
time upon public affairs, I here arose to take my leave.
His Excellency asked me if I had any good news from
America? I answered, none very late. He then said, he
should be very glad to form an acquaintance with me.
I answered, this would be very flattering to me, and thus
took my leave.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning, I propose to go to the President of
the States-General, to Secretary Fagel, and to the Secretary
of the Prince. This moment, for the first time, I
have received the Congress account of General Morgan's
glorious victory over Tarleton.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, May 7th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 4th of May, I did myself the honor to wait on
Peter Van Bleiswick, Grand Pensionary of Holland, and
presented him a letter containing a copy of my Memorial
to the States-General, &amp;c. His Excellency said, that it
was necessary for me to go to the President and Secretary
of their High Mightinesses, and that it was not customary
for foreign Ministers to communicate anything to the
Pensionary of Holland. I told him that I had been advised
by the French Ambassador to present copies to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
and they were only copies, which I had the honor to offer
him. He said he could not receive them, that I must go
to the President; but said he, "it is proper for me to apprise
you, that the President will make a difficulty, or
rather will refuse to receive any letter or paper from you,
because the State you say you represent, is not yet acknowledged
to be a sovereign State by the Sovereign of
this nation; the President will hear what you have to say
to him, make report of it to their High Mightinesses, and
they will transmit it to the several Provinces for the deliberation
of the various members of the sovereignty."</p>

<p>I thanked his Excellency for this information and departed.
I then waited on the President of their High
Mightinesses for the week, the Baron Linde de Hemmen,
a deputy of the Province of Guelderland, to whom I communicated,
that I had lately received from my sovereign,
the United States of America in Congress assembled, a
commission with full powers and instructions to treat with
the States-General concerning a treaty of amity and commerce;
that I had also received a letter of credence as
Minister Plenipotentiary to their High Mightinesses, and I
prayed him to lay before their High Mightinesses either
the originals, or a Memorial, in which I had done myself
the honor to state all these and to enclose copies.</p>

<p>The President said that he could not undertake to receive
from me either the originals, or any Memorial, because
America was not yet acknowledged as a sovereign
State by the sovereign of this country; but that he would
make report to their High Mightinesses of all that I had
said to him, and that it would become the subject of deliberation
in the several Provinces; that he thought it a matter
of great importance to the Republic. I answered, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
I was glad to hear him say that he thought it important;
that I thought it was the interest of the two Republics to
become connected. I thanked him for his politeness and
retired, after having apprised him that I thought in the present
circumstances, it would be my duty to make public in
print my application to their High Mightinesses. I had
prepared copies of my Memorial, &amp;c. for the Secretary,
M. Fagel; but as the President had refused to receive the
originals, I thought it would be inconsistent for the Secretary
to receive copies, so I omitted the visit to his office.</p>

<p>I then waited on the Baron de Ray, the Secretary of
the Prince, with a letter addressed to his Most Serene
Highness, containing a Memorial, informing him of my
credentials to his Court, and copies of the Memorial to
their High Mightinesses. The Secretary received me
politely, look the letter, and promised to deliver it to the
Stadtholder. He asked me where I lodged; I answered,
at the Parliament of England, a public house of that name.</p>

<p>Returning to my lodgings, I heard about two hours afterwards,
that the Prince had been to the assembly of the
States-General for about half an hour; and in about another
hour, the servant of the house where I lodged, announced
to me the Baron de Ray. I went down to the
door to receive him, and invited him into my room. He
entered, and said that he was charged on the part of the
Prince with his compliments to me, and to inform me, that
as the independence of my country was not yet acknowledged
by the Sovereign of his, he could not receive any letter
from me, and therefore requested that I would receive
it back, which I did respectfully. The Secretary then
politely said he was very much obliged to me for having
given him an opportunity to see my person, and took his
leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>The President made report to their High Mightinesses,
as soon as they assembled, and his report was ordered to
be recorded; whereupon the Deputies of each of the
Seven Provinces demanded copies of the record to be
transmitted to the respective Regencies for their deliberation
and decision; or in the technical language of this
country, it was taken <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad referendum</i> on the same day.</p>

<p>The next morning I waited on the French Ambassador,
the Duc de la Vauguyon, and acquainted him with all the
steps I had taken. He said he still persisted in his opinion,
that the time was not the most favorable, but as the
measure was taken, I might depend upon it he would, as
an individual, support and promote it to the utmost of his
power.</p>

<p>It would take a large space to explain all the reasons
and motives which I had for choosing the present time in
preference to a later; but I think I can demonstrate, that
every moment's delay would have been attended with danger
and inconvenience. All Europe is in a crisis, and this
ingredient thrown in at this time will have more effect than
at any other. At a future time I may enlarge upon this
subject.</p>

<h3>TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, May 8th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor of yours of the 29th of April, and according
to your desire I have enclosed a list of the bills
accepted, with the times of their becoming due, and shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
draw for the money to discharge them only as they become
payable, and through the house of Fizeaux &amp; Grand.</p>

<p>I sincerely congratulate you upon the noble aid obtained
from the French Court, for the current service of the year.
Aids like this for two or three years, while the United
States are arranging their finances, will be a most essential
service to the common cause, and will lay a foundation of
confidence and affection between France and the United
States, which may last forever, and be worth ten times the
sum of money. It is in the power of America to tax all
Europe whenever she pleases, by laying duties upon her
exports enough to pay the interest of money enough to
answer all their purposes. England received into her Exchequer
four hundred thousand pounds sterling in duties
upon the single article of tobacco, imported from Virginia
annually. What should hinder the government of Virginia
from laying on the same, or a greater duty, on the exportation?
Europe would still purchase Virginia tobacco, if
there were eight pounds per hogshead duty to be paid.
Virginia alone, therefore, could in this way easily pay the
interest of money enough to carry on the whole war for
the thirteen States for many years. The same reasoning
is applicable to every article of export.</p>

<p>Yesterday were presented to me fifty bills of exchange
for eleven hundred guilders each, drawn by Congress upon
me on the 27th day of January, 1781, at six months sight.
And on the same day other bills from No. 37 to No. 76
inclusively, drawn on me on the same 27th day of January,
1781, for five hundred and fifty guilders each, payable at
six months sight, were presented to me. I asked time to
write to your Excellency, to know if these bills and the
others, drawn at the same time, can be discharged by you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
If they cannot, it will be wrong to accept them, for I have
no prospect at all of getting the money here, unless the
States-General, who have taken the independence of America
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad referendum</i>, should determine to acknowledge it.</p>

<p>About the same time that their High Mightinesses took
the acknowledgment of the independence of the United
States <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad referendum</i>, M. Van Berckel demanded a declaration
of his innocence, or a trial. Whether the two
affairs will aid or counteract each other I cannot tell.</p>

published in English, French, and Dutch, and has been
favorably received by the public; but the public voice has
not that influence upon government in any part of Europe
that it has in every part of America, and therefore I
cannot expect that any immediate effect will be produced
upon the States-General. They will probably wait until
they can sound the disposition of the Northern Powers,
Russia particularly; and if they should not join in the
war, their High Mightinesses will probably be willing to
be admitted to accede to the treaty of alliance between
France and America.</p>

The Dutch fleet of about ten-sail of vessels from the

southern States of America of continual fighting, in which
our countrymen have done themselves great honor; the
capture of half the convoy under Hotham, by the Chevalier
de la Motte Piquet, and the destruction made at Gibraltar
by the Spaniards, have raised the spirits of this
nation from that unmanly gloom and despondency, into
which they were thrown by the capture of St Eustatia,
Demerara, and Essequibo. But after all, this country at
present, is divided in sentiments; it is an Alexandrine, that
"like a wounded snake drags its slow length along."</p>

"Congress have no expectations from the influence, which the people
may have on the British counsels, whatever may be the dispositions of
that nation or their magistrates towards these United States, nor are
they of opinion, that a change of Ministry would produce a change of
measures. They therefore hope, that you will be very cautious of admitting
your measures to be influenced by presumptions of such events,
